**HISTORICAL NOTE**  

The Birds was first produced at the drama festival in 414 BC, where it won second prize. At this period, during the Peloponnesian War, Athens was very powerful and confident, having just launched the expedition to Sicily, fully expecting to triumph in that venture and in the larger war.

Scene: A rugged, treed wilderness area up in the rocky hills. Enter Pisthetairos and Euelpides, both very tired. They are clambering down from the rocky heights towards the level stage. Pisthetairos has a crow perched on his arm or shoulder,and Euelpides has a jackdaw. Both Pisthetairos and Euelpides are carrying packs on their back. They are followed by two slaves carrying more bags. The slaves stay well out of the way until they get involved in the action later on.  


EUELPIDES [speaking to the bird he is carrying]  
 Are you telling us to keep going straight ahead?
 Over there by that tree?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Blast this bird—  
 it’s croaking for us to head back, go home.  

EUELPIDES  
 Why are we wandering up and down like this?
 You’re such a fool—this endless weaving round  
 will kill us both.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 I must be an idiot  
 to keep hiking on along these pathways,  
 a hundred miles at least, and just because  
 that’s what this crow keeps telling me to do.  

EUELPIDES  
 What about me? My poor toe nails are thrashed.                             
 I’ve worn them out because I’m following  
 what this jackdaw says.  

PISTHETAIROS [looking around]  
 I have no idea  
 where on earth we are.  

EUELPIDES  
 You mean from here  
 you couldn’t make it back to your place?                                                                  

PISTHETAIROS:  
 No way—not even Execestides  
 could manage that.[^note-101]  

EUELPIDES  
 We’re in a real mess.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Well, you could try going along that pathway.  

[The two men start exploring different paths down to opposite sides of the stage]  

EUELPIDES  
 We two were conned by that Philokrates,  
 the crazy vendor in the marketplace  
 who sells his birds on trays. He claimed these two                
 would take us straight to Tereus the hoopoe,  
 a man who years ago became a bird.  
 That’s why we paid an obol for this one,  
 this jackdaw, son of Tharreleides.*
 and three more for the crow. And then what?
 The two know nothing, except how to bite.  

[The jackdaw with Euelpides begins to get excited about something. Euelpides talks to the bird]  

 What’s got your attention now? In those rocks?                                                
 You want to take us there? There’s no way through.  

PISTHETAIROS [calling across the stage to Euelpides]  
 By god, the same thing over here, no road.  

EUELPIDES  
 What’s your crow saying about the pathway?                                        

PISTHETAIROS  
 By god, it’s not cawing what it did before.  

EUELPIDES [shouting]  
 But what’s it saying about the road?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Nothing—  
 it’s saying nothing, just keeps on croaking—  
 something about biting my fingers off.  

EUELPIDES [addressing the audience]  
 Don’t you think it’s really odd the two of us,  
 ready and eager to head off for the birds,[^note-102]  
 just can’t find the way. You see, we’re not well.  
 All you men sitting there to hear our words,                                                         
 we’re ill with a disease, not like the one  
 which Sacas suffers,[^note-103]   no—the opposite.                                                      
 He’s no true citizen, yet nonetheless  
 he’s pushing his way in by force, but we,  
 both honoured members of our tribe and clan,[^note-104]  
 both citizens among you citizens,  
 with no one trying to drive us from the city,  
 have winged our way out of our native land  
 on our two feet. We don’t hate the city  
 because we think it’s not by nature great  
 and truly prosperous—open to all,  
 so they can spend their money paying fines.                                         
 Cicadas chirp up in the trees a while,  
 a month or two, but our Athenians                                                                                 
 keep chirping over lawsuits all their lives.  
 That’s why right now we’ve set off on this trip,  
 with all this stuff—basket, pot, and myrtle boughs.[^note-105]  
 We’re looking for a nice relaxing spot,  
 where we can settle down, live out our lives.  
 We’re heading for Tereus, that hoopoe bird—  
 we’d like to know if in his flying around  
 he’s seen a city like the one we want.                                                           

PISTHETAIROS  
 Hey!  

EUELPIDES  
 What?

PISTHETAIROS  
 My crow keeps cawing upwards—  
 up there.  

EUELPIDES  
 My jackdaw’s looking up there, too,                                                                               
 as if it wants to show me something.  
 There must be birds around these rocks. I know—  
 let’s make noise and then we’ll see for sure.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 You know what you should do? Kick that outcrop.  

EUELPIDES  
 Why not use your head? There’d be twice the noise.  

[Pisthetairos and Euelpides start climbing back up the rocky outcrops towards a door in the middle of the rocks]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Pick up a stone and then knock on the door.  

EUELPIDES  
 All right. Here I go.  

[Euelpides knocks very loudly on the door and calls out]  

 Hey, boy . . . boy!  

PISTHETAIROS  
 What are you saying? Why call the hoopoe “boy”?                          
 Don’t say that—you should call out  
       [giving a bird call]  
                                             “hoopoe-ho.”  

EUELPIDES [knocking on the door and calling again]  
Hoopoe-ho! . . . Should I knock again? . . . Hoopoe-ho!  

SERVANT-BIRD [inside]  
 Who is it? Who’s shouting for my master?                                                               

[The door opens and an actor-bird emerges. He has a huge beak which terrifies Euelpides and Pisthetairos. 
They fall back in fear, and the birds they have been carrying disappear]  

EUELPIDES  
 My lord Apollo, save us! That gaping beak—  

SERVANT-BIRD [also frightened]  
 Oh, oh, now we’re in for it. You two men,  
 you’re bird-catchers!  

EUELPIDES  
 Don’t act so weird!  
 Can’t you say something nice?

SERVANT-BIRD [trying to scare them off]  
 You two men will die!  

EUELPIDES  
 But we’re not men.  

SERVANT-BIRD  
What? What are you, then?

EUELPIDES  
 Well . . . I’m a chicken-shitter . . . a Libyan bird . . .  

SERVANT-BIRD  
 That’s rubbish.  

EUELPIDES  
 No, it’s not—I’ve just dropped my load—              
 down both my legs. Take a look.  

SERVANT-BIRD  
 And this one here?
 What kind of bird is he?

[to Pisthetairos]  
 Can you speak?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Me? . . . a crapper-fowl . . . from Phasis.  

EUELPIDES  
 God knows what kind of animal you are!  

SERVANT-BIRD  
 I’m a servant bird.  

EUELPIDES  
 Beaten by some rooster                                                             
 in a cock fight?

SERVANT-BIRD  
 No. It was my master—  
 when he became a hoopoe, well, I prayed  
 that I could turn into a bird. That way  
 he’d still have me to serve and wait on him.  

EUELPIDES  
 Does a bird need his own butler bird?                                                          

SERVANT-BIRD  
 He does—I think it’s got something to do  
 with the fact that earlier he was a man.  
 So if he wants to taste some fish from Phalerum,  
 I grab a plate and run off for sardines.  
 If he wants soup, we need pot and ladle,  
 so I dash off for the spoon.  

EUELPIDES  
A runner bird—  
 that’s what you are. Well, my little runner,  
 do you know what we’d like to have you do?                                                                     
 Go call your master for us.  

SERVANT-BIRD  
 But he’s asleep—  
 for heaven’s sake, his after-dinner snooze—                       
 he’s just had gnats and myrtle berries.  

EUELPIDES  
 Wake him up anyway.  

SERVANT-BIRD  
 I know for sure  
 he’ll be annoyed, but I’ll do it, just for you.  

[Exit Servant-Bird back through the doors]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Damn that bird—he scared me half to death.  

EUELPIDES  
 Bloody hell—he frightened off my bird!  

PISTHETAIROS  
 You’re such a coward—the worst there is.  
 Were you so scared you let that jackdaw go?

EUELPIDES  
 What about you? Didn’t you collapse  
 and let your crow escape?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Not me, by god.  

EUELPIDES  
 Where is it then?

PISTHETAIROS  
It flew off on its own.  

EUELPIDES  
 You didn’t let go? What a valiant man!  

TEREUS: [from inside, speaking in a grand style]  
 Throw open this wood, so I may issue forth.  

[The doors open. Enter Tereus, a hoopoe bird, with feathers on his head and wings but none on his body. 
He struts and speaks with a ridiculously affected confidence. Euelpides and Pisthetairos are greatly amused 
at his appearance]  

EUELPIDES  
 O Hercules, what kind of beast is this?
 What’s that plumage? What sort of triple crest?

TEREUS  
 Who are the persons here who seek me out?

EUELPIDES  
 The twelve gods, it seems, have worked you over.[^note-106]  

TEREUS  
 Does seeing my feathers make you scoff at me?
 Strangers, I was once upon a time a man.  

EUELPIDES  
 It’s not you we’re laughing at.  

TEREUS  
 Then what is it?

EUELPIDES  
 It’s your beak—to us it looks quite funny.                                             

TEREUS  
 It’s how Sophocles distorts Tereus—                                                                            
 that’s me—in his tragedies.  

EUELPIDES  
You’re Tereus?
 Are you a peacock or a bird?[^note-107]  

TEREUS  
I am a bird.  

EUELPIDES  
 Then where are all your feathers?

TEREUS  
 They’ve fallen off.  

EUELPIDES  
 Have you got some disease?

TEREUS  
 No, it’s not that.  
 In winter time all birds shed their feathers,  
 then new ones grow again. But tell me this—  
 who are the two of you?

EUELPIDES  
 Us? We’re human beings.  

TEREUS  
 From what race were you born?

EUELPIDES  
 Our origin?
 In Athens—which makes the finest warships.                                    

TEREUS  
 Ah, so you’re jury-men, are you?

EUELPIDES  
 No, no.  
 We’re different—we keep away from juries.  

TEREUS  
 Does that seedling flourish in those parts?                                                            

EUELPIDES  
 If you go searching in the countryside,  
 you’ll find a few.  

TEREUS  
 So why have you come here?
 What do you need?

EUELPIDES  
 To talk to you.  

TEREUS  
 What for?        

EUELPIDES  
 Well, you were once a man, as we are now.  
 You owed people money, as we do now.  
 You loved to skip the debt, as we do now.  
 Then you changed your nature, became a bird.                              
 You fly in circles over land and sea.  
 You’ve learned whatever’s known to birds and men.  
 That’s why we’ve come as suppliants to you,                                                      
 to ask if you can tell us of some town,  
 where life is sheepskin soft, where we can sleep.  

TEREUS  
 Are you looking for a mighty city,  
 more powerful than what Cranaus built?[^note-108]  

EUELPIDES  
 Not one more powerful, no. What we want  
 is one which better suits the two of us.  

TEREUS  
 You clearly want an aristocracy.                                          

EUELPIDES  
 Me? No, not at all. The son of Scellias  
 is someone I detest.[^note-109]  

TEREUS  
 All right, then,  
 What kind of city would you like to live in?

EUELPIDES  
 I’d like a city where my biggest problem  
 would be something like this—in the morning  
 a friend comes to my door and says to me,  
         “In the name of Olympian Zeus, take a bath,                                                    
 an early one, you and your children,  
 then come to my place for the wedding feast  
 I’m putting on. Don’t disappoint me now.                                            
 If you do, then don’t come looking for me  
 when my affairs get difficult for me.”[^note-110]  

TEREUS  
 By heaven, you poor man, you do love trouble.  
 What about you?

PISTHETAIROS  
 I’d like the same.  

TEREUS  
 Like what?

PISTHETAIROS  
 To have the father of some handsome lad  
 come up to me, as if I’d done him wrong,  
 and tell me off with some complaint like this—  
         “A fine thing there between you and my son,                                                   
 you old spark. You met him coming back  
 from the gymnasium, after his bath—                                 
 you didn’t kiss or greet him with a hug,  
 or even try tickling his testicles—  
 yet you’re a friend of mine, his father.”  

TEREUS  
 How you yearn for problems, you unhappy man.  
 There is a happy city by the sea,  
 the Red Sea, just like the one you mention.[^note-111]  

EUELPIDES  
 No, no. Not by the sea! That’s not for us,  
 not where that ship Salamia can show up  
 with some man on board to serve a summons  
 early in the morning. What about Greece?                                          
 Can you tell us of some city there?[^note-112]  

TEREUS  
 Why not go and settle down in Elis—  
 in Lepreus?

EUELPIDES  
 In Leprous? By the gods,  
 I hate the place—although I’ve never seen it—                                                
 it’s all Melanthius’ fault.[^note-113]  

TEREUS  
 You could go  
 to the Opuntians—they’re in Locris—  
 you might settle there.  

EUELPIDES  
 Be Opuntius—  
 no way, not for a talent’s weight in gold.[^note-114]  
 But what’s it like here, living with the birds?
 You must know it well.  

TEREUS  
 It’s not unpleasant.                                  
 First of all, you have to live without a purse.  

EUELPIDES  
 So you’re rid of one great source of fraud in life.  

TEREUS  
 In the gardens we enjoy white sesame,                                                                    
 the myrtles, mint, and poppies.  

EUELPIDES  
 So you live  
 just like newly-weds.  

PISTHETAIROS  
That’s it! I’ve got it!  
 I see a great plan for this race of birds—  
 and power, too, if you’ll trust what I say.  

TEREUS  
 What do you want to get us all to do?

PISTHETAIROS  
 What should you be convinced to do? Well, first,  
 don’t just fly about in all directions,                                                            
 your beaks wide open—that makes you despised.  
 With us, you see, if you spoke of men  
 who always flit about and if you asked,  
> “Who’s that Teleas” someone would respond,  
> The man’s a bird—he’s unreliable,  
 flighty, vague, never stays in one place long.”[^note-115]    

TEREUS  
 By Dionysus, that’s a valid point—  
 the criticism’s fair. What should we do?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Settle down together in one city.  

TEREUS  
 What sort of city could we birds set up?                                                  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Why ask that? What a stupid thing to say!  
 Look down.  

TEREUS  
All right.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Now look up.  

TEREUS  
 I’m looking up.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Turn your head round to the side.  

TEREUS  
 By Zeus,  
 this’ll do me good, if I twist off my neck.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 What do you see?

TEREUS  
 Clouds and sky.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Well, then,  
 isn’t this a staging area for birds?

TEREUS  
 A staging area? How come it’s that?

PISTHETAIROS  
 You might say it’s a location for them—                                                                 
 there’s lots of business here, but everything  
 keeps moving through this zone, so it’s now called              
 a staging place. But if you settled here,  
 fortified it, and fenced it off with walls,  
 this staging area could become your state.  
 Then you’d rule all men as if they’re locusts  
 and annihilate the gods with famine,  
 just like in Melos.[^note-116]  

TEREUS  
How’d we manage that?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Look, between earth and heaven there’s the air.  
 Now, with us, when we want to go to Delphi,  
 we have to ask permission to pass through  
 from the Boeotians. You should do the same.                                   
 When men sacrifice, make gods pay you cash.                                                 
 If not, you don’t grant them rights of passage.  
 You’ll stop the smell of roasting thigh bones  
 moving through an empty space and city  
 which don’t belong to them.  

TEREUS  
 Wow!!! Yippee!!  
 By earth, snares, traps, nets, what a marvellous scheme!  
 I’ve never heard a neater plan! So now,  
 with your help, I’m going to found a city,  
 if other birds agree.  

PISTHETAIROS  
The other birds?
 Who’s going to lay this business out to them?                                   

TEREUS  
 You can do it. I’ve taught them how to speak.                                                   
 Before I came, they could only twitter,  
 but I’ve been with them here a long, long time.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 How do you call to bring them all together?

TEREUS  
 Easy. I’ll step inside my thicket here,  
 and wake my nightingale. Then we’ll both call.  
 Once they hear our voices they’ll come running.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 O, you darling bird, now don’t just stand there—  
 not when I’m begging you to go right now,  
 get in your thicket, wake your nightingale.                                          

[Tereus goes back through the doors][^note-117]  

TEREUS [singing]  
 Come my queen, don’t sleep so long,  
 pour forth the sound of sacred song—                                                       
 lament once more through lips divine  
 for Itys, your dead child and mine,  
 the one we’ve cried for all this time.[^note-118]  

 Sing out your music’s liquid trill  
 in that vibrato voice—the thrill  
 which echoes in those purest tones  
 through leafy haunts of yew trees roams  
 and rises up to Zeus’ throne.                                                                 

 Apollo with the golden hair  
 sits listening to your music there—  
 and in response he plucks his string—  
 his lyre of ivory then brings  
 the gods themselves to dance and sing.  

 Then from gods’ mouths in harmony                                                          
 come sounds of sacred melody.  

[A flute starts playing within, in imitation of the nightingale’s song. The melody continues for a few moments]  

EUELPIDES  
 By lord Zeus, that little birdie’s got a voice!  
 She pours her honey all through that thicket!  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Hey!  

EUELPIDES  
 What?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Shut up.  

EUELPIDES  
 Why?

PISTHETAIROS  
 That hoopoe bird—270                           
 he’s all set to sing another song.  

TEREUS [issuing a bird call to all the birds. His song or chant is accompanied by the flute indicating the nightingale’s song]  

 Epo-popo-popo-popo-popoi,  
 Io, io, ito, ito, ito, ito.  

 Come here to me,  
 all you with feathers just like mine,                                                                             
 all you who live in country fields  
 fresh-ploughed, still full of seed,  
 and all you thousand tribes  
 who munch on barley corn  
 who gather up the grain,                                                                                          
 and fly at such a speed  
 and utter your sweet cries,  
 all you who in the furrows there  
 twitter on the turned-up earth,  
 and sweetly sing  
 tio tio tio tio tio tio tio tio—  

 All those of you  
 who like to scavenge food  
 from garden ivy shoots,                                                                                                            
 all you in the hills up there                                                  
 who eat from olive and arbutus trees.  
 come here as quickly as you can,  
 fly here in answer to this call—  
 trio-to trio-to toto-brix!  

 And every one of you  
 in low-lying marshy ground  
 who snap sharp-biting gnats,  
 by regions of well-watered land,  
 and lovely fields of Marathon,  
 all you variously coloured birds,                                                                      
 godwits and francolins—  
 I’m calling you.  

 You flocks who fly across the seas                                                                                  
 across the waves with halcyons  
 come here to learn the news.  
 We’re all assembling here,  
 all tribes of long-neck birds.  
 A shrewd old man’s arrived—  
 he’s here with a new plan,  
 a man of enterprise,                                                                                                     
 all set to improvise.  
 So gather all of you  
 to hear his words.  

[The final words gradually change from coherent speech into a bird call]  

 Come here, come here,  
 come here, come here.  
 Toro-toro toro-toro-tix  
 Kik-kabau, kik-kabau.                                                                                                               
 Toro-toro toro-toro li-li-lix  

[Euelpides and Pisthetairos start looking up into the sky for birds]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Seen any birds lately?

EUELPIDES  
 No, by Apollo, I haven’t—  
 even though I’m staring up into the sky,                                                 
 not even blinking.  

PISTHETAIROS  
It seems to me  
 that hoopoe bird was just wasting time  
 hiding, like a curlew, in that thicket,  
 and screaming out his bird calls—  
         [imitating Tereus] po-poi po-poi        

[There is an instant response to Pisthetairos’ call from off stage, a loud bird call which really scares Pisthetairos and Euelpides]  

BIRD [offstage]  
 Toro-tix, toro-tix.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Hey, my good man, here comes a bird.  

[Enter a flamingo, very tall and flaming red-something Pisthetairos and Euelpides have never seen]  

EUELPIDES  
 By Zeus,  
 that’s a bird? What kind would you call that?
 It couldn’t be a peacock, could it?

[Tereus re-enters from the thicket]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Tereus here will tell us. Hey, my friend,                                                  
 what’s that bird there?

TEREUS  
 Not your everyday fowl—  
 the kind you always see. She’s a marsh bird.                                                       

EUELPIDES  
 My goodness, she’s gorgeous—flaming red!  

TEREUS  
 Naturally, that’s why she’s called Flamingo.  

[A second bird enters, a Peacock]  

EUELPIDES [to Pisthetairos]  
 Hey . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
 What is it?

EUELPIDES  
 Another bird’s arrived.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 You’re right. By god, this one looks really odd.  
         [To Tereus] Who’s this bizarre bird-prophet of the Muse,  
 this strutter from the hills?

TEREUS  
 He’s called the Mede.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 He’s a Mede? By lord Hercules, how come  
 a Mede flew here without his camel?                                                          

EUELPIDES  
 Here’s another one . . .  

[The next bird enters, another Hoopoe]  

. . . what a crest of feathers!  
PISTHETAIROS [To Tereus]  
 What’s this marvel? You’re not the only hoopoe?                                          
 This here’s another one?

TEREUS  
He’s my grandson—  
 son of Philocles the Hoopoe—it’s like  
 those names you pass along, when you call  
 Hipponicus the son of Callias,  
 and Callias son of Hipponicus.[^note-119]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 So this bird is Callias. His feathers—  
 he seems to have lost quite a few.  

TEREUS  
 Yes, that’s true—  
 being a well-off bird he’s plucked by parasites,                                
 and female creatures flock around him, too,  
 to yank his plumage out.  

[Enter the Glutton-bird, an invented species, very fat and brightly coloured]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 By Poseidon,  
 here’s another bright young bird. What’s it called?

TEREUS  
 This one’s the Glutton-bird.  

PISTHETAIROS  
Another glutton?
 Cleonymus is not the only one?[^note-120]  

EUELPIDES  
 If this bird were like our Cleonymus,                                                                         
 wouldn’t he have thrown away his crest?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Why do all the birds display such head crests?
 Are they going to run a race in armour?

TEREUS  
 No, my dear fellow, they live up on the crests,                                 
 because it’s safer, like the Carians.[^note-121]  

PISTHETAIROS [looking offstage]  
 Holy Poseidon, do you see those birds!  
 What a fowl bunch of them—all flocking here!  

EUELPIDES [looking in the same direction]  
 Lord Apollo, there’s a huge bird cloud! Wow!  
 So many feathered wings in there I can’t see  
 a way through all those feathers to the wings.  

[Enter the Chorus of Birds in a dense mass. Pisthetairos and Euelpides clamber up the rock to get a better look at them]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Hey, look at that—  
 it’s a partridge, and that one over there,  
 by Zeus, a francolin—there’s a widgeon—  
 and that’s a halcyon!  

EUELPIDES  
 What’s the one behind her?

PISTHETAIROS  
 What is it? It’s a spotted shaver.  

EUELPIDES  
 Shaver?                                      
 You mean there’s a bird that cuts our hair?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Why not?
 After all, there’s that barber in the city—  
 the one we all call Sparrow Sporgilos.[^note-122]                                                                       
 Here comes an owl.  

EUELPIDES  
Well, what about that?
 Who brings owls to Athens?[^note-123]  

PISTHETAIROS [identifying birds in the crowd]  
. . . a turtle dove,  
 a jay, lark, sedge bird . . .  

EUELPIDES  
. . . finch, pigeon . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
                                                                . . . falcon,  
 hawk, ring dove . . .  

EUELPIDES  
. . . cuckoo, red shank . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
                                                             . . . fire-crest . . .  

EUELPIDES  
         . . . porphyrion, kestrel, dabchick, bunting,  
 vulture, and that one’s there’s a . . . [he’s stumped]  

PISTHETAIROS  
. . . woodpecker!!  

EUELPIDES  
 What a crowd of birds! A major flock of fowls!                                
 All that twitter as they prance around,  
 those rival cries! . . . Oh, oh, what’s going on?
 Are they a threat? They’re looking straight at us—  
 their beaks are open!  

PISTHETAIROS  
It looks that way to me.  

CHORUS LEADER [starting with a bird call]  
 To-toto-to to-toto-to to-to.                                                                                                  
 Who’s been calling me?
 Where’s he keep his nest?

TEREUS  
 I’m the one. I’ve been waiting here a while.  
 I’ve not left my bird friends in the lurch.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Ti-tit-ti ti-tit-ti ti-ti-ti-ti                                                        
 tell me as a friend what you have to say.  

TEREUS  
 I have news for all of us—something safe,  
 judicious, sweet, and profitable.  
 Two men have just come here to visit me,  
 two subtle thinkers . . .  

CHORUS LEADER [interrupting]  
 What? What are you saying?

TEREUS  
 I’m telling you two old men have arrived—                                                        
 they’ve come from lands where human beings live  
 and bring the stalk of a stupendous plan.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 You fool! This is the most disastrous thing  
 since I was hatched. What are you telling us?                                    

TEREUS  
 Don’t be afraid of what I have to say.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 What have you done to us?

TEREUS  
 I’ve welcomed here  
 two men in love with our society.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 You dared to do that?

TEREUS  
 Yes, indeed, I did.  
 And I’m very pleased I did so.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 These two men of yours,  
 are they among us now?

TEREUS  
Yes, as surely as I am.  

CHORUS [breaking into a song of indignation]  
 Aiiii, aiiiii  
 He’s cheated us,  
 he’s done us wrong.  
 That friend of ours,                                                                                         
 who all along  
 has fed with us  
 in fields we share,                                                                                                            
 now breaks old laws  
 and doesn’t care.  

 We swore a pact  
 of all the birds.  
 He’s now trapped us  
 with deceitful words—  
 so power goes                                                              
 to all our foes,  
 that wicked race  
 which since its birth  
 was raised for war  
 with us on earth.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 We’ll have some words with that one later.  
 These two old men should get their punishment—  
 I think we should give it now. Let’s do it—  
 rip ’em to pieces, bit by bit.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 We’re done for.  

EUELPIDES  
 It’s all your fault—getting us into this mess.                                        
 Why’d you bring me here?

PISTHETAIROS  
I wanted you to come.                                                     

EUELPIDES  
 What? So I could weep myself to death?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Now, you’re really talking nonsense—  
 how do you intend to weep, once these birds  
 poke out your eyes?

CHORUS [advancing towards Pisthetairos and Euelpides  
On, on . . .  
 let’s move in to attack,  
 and launch a bloody rush,  
 come in from front and back,  
 and break ’em in the crush—  
 with wings on every side                                                      
 they’ll have no place to hide.  

 These two will start to howl,  
 when my beak starts to eat  
 and makes ’em food for fowl.  
 There’s no well-shaded peak,  
 no cloud or salt-grey sea                                                                                                         
 where they can flee from me.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Now let’s bite and tear these two apart!  
 Where’s the brigadier? Bring up the right wing!  

[The birds start to close in on Pisthetairos and Euelpides, cowering up on the rocks]  

EUELPIDES  
 This is it! I’m done for. Where can I run?                                              

PISTHETAIROS  
 Why aren’t you staying put?

EUELPIDES  
 Here with you?
 I don’t want ’em to rip me into pieces.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 How do you intend to get away from them?

EUELPIDES  
 I haven’t a clue.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Then I’ll tell you how—  
 we have to stay right here and fight it out.  
 So put that cauldron down.  

[Pisthetairos takes the cauldron from Euelpides and sets it down on the ground in front of them]  

EUELPIDES  
 What good’s a cauldron?

PISTHETAIROS  
 It’ll keep the owls away from us.  

EUELPIDES  
 What about the birds with claws?

PISTHETAIROS [rummaging in the pack]  
Grab this spit—  
 stick it in the ground in front of you.  

EUELPIDES  
 How do we protect our eyes?                                                                                              

PISTHETAIROS [producing a couple of tin bowls]  
 An upturned bowl.                                          
 Set this on your head.  

EUELPIDES: [putting the tin bowl upside down on his head and holding up the pot, with the spit stuck in the ground]  
 That’s brilliant!  
 What a grand stroke of warlike strategy!  
 In military matters you’re the best—  
 already smarter than that Nikias[^note-124]  

[Pisthetairos and Euelpides, with tin bowls on their heads, await the birds’ charge-with Pisthetairos hiding behind 
Euelpides, who is holding up the big pot. Their two slaves cower behind them]  

CHORUS LEADER  
El-el-el-eu . . . Charge!  
 Keep those beaks level—no holding back now!  
 Pull ‘em, scratch ’em, hit ’em, rip their skins off!  
 Go smash that big pot first of all.  

[As the Chorus is about to start its charge, Tereus rushes in between the two men and the Chorus and tries 
to stop the Chorus Leader]  

TEREUS  
 Hold on, you wickedest of animals!  
 Tell me this: Why do you want to kill these men,                         
 to tear them both to bits? They’ve done no wrong.  
 Besides, they’re my wife’s relatives, her clansmen.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Why should we be more merciful to them  
 than we are to wolves? What other animals  
 are greater enemies of ours than them?
 Have we got better targets for revenge?                                                                  

TEREUS  
 Yes, by nature enemies—but what if  
 they’ve got good intentions? What if they’ve come  
 to teach you something really valuable?

CHORUS LEADER  
 How could they ever teach us anything,                                                  
 or tell us something useful—they’re enemies,  
 our feathered forefathers’ fierce foes.  

TEREUS  
 But folks with fine minds find from foemen  
 they can learn a lot. Caution saves us all.  
 We don’t learn that from friends. But enemies  
 can force that truth upon us right away.  
 That’s why cities learn, not from their allies,  
 but from enemies, how to build high walls,  
 assemble fleets of warships—in that way,  
 their knowledge saves their children, homes, and goods. 490             

CHORUS LEADER  
 Well, here’s what seems best to me—first of all,  
 let’s hear what they have come to say. It’s true—  
 our enemies can teach us something wise.  

PISTHETAIROS [to Euelpides}
 I think their anger’s easing off. Let’s retreat.  

[Pisthetairos and Euelpides inch their way toward the doors, still bunched together, with Euelpides holding up the pot]  

TEREUS [to the Chorus Leader]  
 It’s only fair—and you do owe me a favour,  
 out of gratitude.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 In other things,  
 before today, we’ve never stood against you.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 They’re acting now more peacefully to us—  
 so put that pot and bowl down on the ground.  
 But we’d better hang onto the spit, our spear.                                   
 We’ll use it on patrol inside our camp                                                                       
 right by this cauldron here. Keep your eyes peeled—  
 don’t even think of flight.  

[Euelpides puts down the cauldron, removes his tin-plate helmet, and marches with the spear back and forth 
by the cauldron, on guard]  

EUELPIDES  
 What happens if we’re killed? Where on earth  
 will we be buried?

PISTHETAIROS  
 In Kerameikos—  
 where the potters live—they’ll bury both of us.  
 We’ll get it done and have the public pay—  
 I’ll tell the generals we died in battle,  
 fighting with the troops at Orneai.[^note-125]  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Fall back into the ranks you held before. 510              
 Bend over, and like well-armed soldier boys,  
 put your spirit and your anger down.  
 We’ll look into who these two men may be,  
 where they come from, what their intentions are.  

[The Chorus of Birds breaks up and retreats]  

 Hey, Hoopoe bird, I’m calling you!  

TEREUS  
You called?
 What would you like to hear?

CHORUS LEADER  
 These two men—  
 where do they come from and who are they?

TEREUS  
 These strangers are from Greece, font of wisdom.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 What accident or words                                                                                                           
 now brings them to the birds?                                                                            

TEREUS  
 The two men love your life,  
 adore the way you live—  
 they want to share with you  
 in all there is to give.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 What’s that you just said?
 What plan is in their head?

TEREUS  
 Things you’d never think about—  
 you’ll be amazed—just hear him out.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 He thinks it’s good that he  
 should stay and live with me?                                                                             
 Is he trusting in some plan  
 to help his fellow man  
 or thump his enemy?                                                                                                                  

TEREUS  
 He talks of happiness  
 too great for thought or words  
 He claims this emptiness—  
 all space—is for the birds—  
 here, there, and everywhere.  
 You’ll be convinced, I swear.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Is he crazy in the head?                                                                                             

TEREUS  
 He is shrewder than I said.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 A brilliant thinking box?

TEREUS  
 The subtlest, sharpest fox—  
 he’s been around a lot  
 knows every scheme and plot.                                                                                          

CHORUS LEADER  
 Ask him to speak to us, to tell us all.  
 As I listen now to what you’re telling me,  
 it makes me feel like flying—taking off!  

TEREUS [to the two slaves]  
 Take their suits of armour in the house—  
 hang the stuff up in the kitchen there,                                                      
 beside the cooking stool—may it bring good luck!  

[turning to Pisthetairos]  

 Now you. Lay out your plans—explain to them  
 the reason why I called them all together.  

[Pisthetairos is struggling with the servants, refusing to give up his armour]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 No. By Apollo, I won’t do it—  
 not unless they swear a pact with me  
 just like one that monkey Panaitios,                                                                           
 who makes our knives, had his wife swear to him—  
 not to bite or pull my balls or poke me.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 You mean up your . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
No, not there. I mean the eyes.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Oh, I’ll agree to that.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Then swear an oath on it.                                        

CHORUS LEADER  
 I swear on this condition—that I get  
 all the judges’ and spectators’ votes and win.[^note-126]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Oh, you’ll win!  

CHORUS LEADER  
 And if I break the oath  
 then let me win by just a single vote.  
 Listen all of you! The armed infantry  
 can now pick up their weapons and go home.  
 Keep an eye out for any bulletins  
 we put up on our notice boards.                                                                                      

CHORUS [singing]  
 Man’s by nature’s born to lie.  
 But state your case. Give it a try.                                                                      
 There’s a chance you have observed  
 some useful things inside this bird,  
 some greater power I possess,  
 which my dull brain has never guessed.  
 So tell all here just what you see.  
 If there’s a benefit to me,  
 we’ll share in it communally.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Tell us the business that’s brings you here.                                                           
 Persuade us of your views. So speak right up.  
 No need to be afraid—we’ve made a pact—                        
 we won’t be the ones who break it first.  

PISTHETAIROS [aside to Euelpides]  
 By god, I’m full of words, bursting to speak.  
 I’ve worked my speech like well-mixed flour—  
 like kneading dough. There’s nothing stopping me.  

[giving instructions to the two slaves]  

 You, lad, fetch me a speaker’s wreath—and, you,  
 bring water here, so I can wash my hands.  

[The two slaves go into the house and return with a wreath and some water]  

EUELPIDES [whispering to Pisthetairos]  
 You mean it’s time for dinner? What’s going on?

PISTHETAIROS  
 For a long time now I’ve been keen, by god,  
 to give them a stupendous speech—overstuffed—  
 something to shake their tiny birdy souls.                                             

[Pisthetairos, with the wreath on his head, now turns to the birds and begins his formal oration]  

 I’m so sorry for you all, who once were kings . . .  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Kings? Us? What of?

PISTHETAIROS  
You were kings indeed,  
 you ruled over everything there is—  
 over him and me, first of all, and then  
 over Zeus himself. You see, your ancestry  
 goes back before old Kronos and the Titans,  
 way back before even Earth herself![^note-127]  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Before the Earth?

PISTHETAIROS  
Yes, by Apollo.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Well, that’s something I never knew before!                                                      

PISTHETAIROS  
 That’s because you’re naturally uninformed—                    
 you lack resourcefulness. You’ve not read Aesop.  
 His story tells us that the lark was born  
 before the other birds, before the Earth.  
 Her father then grew sick and died. For five days  
 he lay there unburied—there was no Earth.  
 Not knowing what to do, at last the lark,  
 at her wits’ end, set him in her own head.  

EUELPIDES  
 So now, the father of the lark lies dead  
 in a headland plot.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 So if they were born  
 before the Earth, before the gods, well then,                                      
 as the eldest, don’t they get the right to rule?

EUELPIDES  
 By Apollo, yes they do.  

[addressing the audience]  

 So you out there,  
 look ahead and sprout yourselves a beak—  
 in good time Zeus will hand his sceptre back                                                     
 to the birds who peck his sacred oaks.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Way back then it wasn’t gods who ruled.  
 They didn’t govern men. No. It was the birds.  
 There’s lots of proof for this. I’ll mention here  
 example number one—the fighting cock—  
 first lord and king of all those Persians,                                                  
 well before the time of human kings—  
 those Dariuses and Megabazuses.  
 Because he was their king, the cock’s still called  
 the Persian Bird.  

EUELPIDES  
 That’s why to this very day  
 the cock’s the only bird to strut about  
 like some great Persian king, and on his head  
 he wears his crown erect.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 He was so great,  
 so mighty and so strong, that even now,  
 thanks to his power then, when he sings out  
 his early morning song, all men leap up                              
 to head for work—blacksmiths, potters, tanners,                                          
 men who deal in corn or supervise the baths,  
 or make our shields or fabricate our lyres—  
 they all lace on their shoes and set off in the dark.  

EUELPIDES  
 I can vouch for that! I had some bad luck,  
 thanks to that cock—I lost my cloak to thieves,  
 a soft and warm one, too, of Phrygian wool.  
 I’d been invited to a festive do,  
 where some child was going to get his name,  
 right here in the city. I’d had some drinks—                        
 and those drinks, well, they made me fall asleep.  
 Before the other guests began to eat,  
 that bird lets rip his cock-a-doodle-doo!  
 I thought it was the early morning call.  
 So I run off for Halimus[^note-128]  —but then,  
 just outside the city walls, I get mugged,  
 some coat thief hits me square across the back—  
 he used a cudgel! When I fall down there,  
 about to cry for help, he steals my cloak!  

PISTHETAIROS  
 To resume—way back then the Kite was king.                                 
 He ruled the Greeks.  

CHORUS LEADER  
King of the Greeks!!  

PISTHETAIROS  
 That’s right.  
 As king he was the first to show us how                                                                   
 to grovel on the ground before a kite.  
        
EUELPIDES  
 By Dionysus, I once saw a kite  
 and rolled along the ground, then, on my back,  
 my mouth wide open, gulped an obol down.  
 I had to trudge home with an empty sack.[^note-129]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Take Egypt and Phoenicia—they were ruled  
 by Cuckoo kings. And when they cried “Cuckoooo!!”  
 all those Phoenicians harvested their crop—                       
 the wheat and barley in their fields.  

EUELPIDES  
 That’s why  
 if someone’s cock is ploughing your wife’s field,  
 we call you “Cuckoo!”—you’re being fooled![^note-130]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 The kingship of the birds was then so strong  
 that in the cities of the Greeks a king—  
 an Agamemnon, say, or Menelaus—  
 had a bird perched on his regal sceptre.  
 And it got its own share of all the gifts                                                                      
 the king received.  

EUELPIDES  
 Now, that I didn’t know.  
 I always get amazed in tragedies           
 when some king Priam comes on with a bird.  
 I guess it stands on guard there, keeping watch  
 to see what presents Lysicrates gets.[^note-131]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Here’s the weirdest proof of all—lord Zeus  
 who now commands the sky, because he’s king,  
 carries an eagle on his head. There’s more—  
 his daughter has an owl, and Apollo,  
 like a servant, has a hawk.  

EUELPIDES  
 That’s right,  
 by Demeter! What’s the reason for those birds?

PISTHETAIROS  
 So when someone makes a sacrifice                                    
 and then, in accordance with tradition,  
 puts the guts into god’s hands, the birds  
 can seize those entrails well before Zeus can.  
 Back then no man would swear upon the gods—  
 they swore their oaths on birds. And even now,                                             
 our Lampon seals his promises “By Goose,”  
 when he intends to cheat.[^note-132]   In days gone by,  
 all men considered you like that—as great  
 and sacred beings. Now they all think of you  
 as slaves and fools and useless layabouts.                                              
 They throw stones at you, as if you’re mad.  
 And every hunter in the temples there  
 sets up his traps—all those nooses, gins,  
 limed sticks and snares, fine mesh and hunting nets,  
 and cages, too. Then once they’ve got you trapped,  
 they sell you by the bunch. Those who come to buy  
 poke and prod your flesh. If you seem good to eat,                                      
 they don’t simply roast you by yourself—no!  
 They grate on cheese, mix oil and silphium  
 with vinegar—and then whip up a sauce,                                               
 oily and sweet, which they pour on you hot,  
 as if you were a chunk of carrion meat.  

CHORUS  
 This human speaks  
 of our great pain  
 our fathers’ sins                                                                                                                 
 we mourn again—  
 born into rule,  
 they threw away  
 what they received,  
 their fathers’ sway.                                                                            

 But now you’ve come—  
 fine stroke of fate—  
 to save our cause.  
 Here let me state  
 I’ll trust myself  
 and all my chicks  
 to help promote  
 your politics.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 You need to stick around to tell us all  
 what we should do. Our lives won’t be worth living              
 unless by using every scheme there is  
 we get back what’s ours—our sovereignty.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Then the first point I’d advise you of is this:                                                        
 there should be one single city of the birds.  
 Next, you should encircle the entire air,  
 all this space between the earth and heaven,  
 with a huge wall of baked brick—like Babylon.  

EUELPIDES  
 O Kebriones and Porphyrion!  
 What a mighty place! How well fortified![^note-133]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 When you’ve completed that, demand from Zeus               
 he give you back your rule. If he says no,  
 he doesn’t want to and won’t sign on at once,  
 you then declare a holy war on him.  
 Tell those gods they can’t come through your space  
 with cocks erect, the way they used to do,  
 rushing down to screw another woman—  
 like Alkmene, Semele, or Alope.[^note-134]  
 For if you ever catch them coming down  
 you’ll stamp your seal right on their swollen pricks—                                      
 they won’t be fucking women any more.                                               
 And I’d advise you send another bird  
 as herald down to human beings to say  
 that since the birds from now on will be kings,  
 they have to offer sacrifice to them.  
 The offerings to the gods take second place.  
 Then each of the gods must be closely matched  
 with an appropriate bird. So if a man  
 is offering Athena holy sacrifice,  
 he must first give the Coot some barley corn.  
 If sacrificing sheep to god Poseidon,                                                           
 let him bring toasted wheat grains to the Duck.  
 And anyone who’s going to sacrifice  
 to Hercules must give the Cormorant  
 some honey cakes. A ram for Zeus the king?
 Then first, because the Wren is king of birds,  
 ahead of Zeus himself, his sacrifice  
 requires the worshipper to execute  
 an uncastrated gnat.  

EUELPIDES  
I like that bit about  
 the slaughtered gnat. Now thunder on, great Zan.[^note-135]                                        

CHORUS LEADER  
 But how will humans think of us as gods                             
 and not just jackdaws flying around on wings?

PISTHETAIROS  
 A foolish question. Hermes is a god,  
 and he has wings and flies—so do others,  
 all sorts of them. There’s Victory, for one,  
 with wings of gold. And Eros is the same.  
 Then there’s Iris—just like a timorous dove,  
 that’s what Homer says.  

EUELPIDES  
But what if Zeus  
 lets his thunder peal, then fires down on us  
 his lightning bolt—that’s got wings as well.  

PISTHETAIROS [ignoring Euelpides]  
Now, if men in their stupidity                                             
 think nothing of you and keep worshipping  
 Olympian gods, then a large cloud of birds,  
 of rooks and sparrows, must attack their farms,  
 devouring all the seed. And as they starve,  
 let Demeter then dole out grain to them.                                                              

EUELPIDES  
 She won’t be willing to do that, by Zeus.  
 She’ll make excuses—as you’ll see.  

PISTHETAIROS  
Then as a test,  
 the ravens can peck out their livestock’s eyes,  
 the ones that pull the ploughs to work the land,  
 and other creatures, too. Let Apollo                                    
 make them better—he’s the god of healing.  
 That’s why he gets paid.  

EUELPIDES  
 But you can’t do this  
 ’til I’ve sold my two little oxen first.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 But if they think of you as god, as life,  
 as Earth, as Kronos and Poseidon, too,  
 then all good things will come to them.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Tell me  
 what these good things are.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Well, for starters,  
 locusts won’t eat the blossoms on their vines.  
 The owls and kestrels in just one platoon  
 will rid them of those pests. Mites and gall wasps 790             
 won’t devour the figs. One troop of thrushes  
 will eradicate them one and all.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 But how will we make people wealthy?
 That’s what they mostly want.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 When people come  
 petitioning your shrines, the birds can show  
 the mining sites that pay. They’ll tell the priest  
 the profitable routes for trade. That way  
 no captain of a ship will be wiped out.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Why won’t those captains come to grief?

PISTHETAIROS  
 They’ll always ask the birds about the trip.                                           
 Their seer will say, “A storm is on the way.  
 Don’t sail just yet” or “Now’s the time to sail—  
 you’ll turn a tidy profit.”  

EUELPIDES  
Hey, that’s for me—  
 I’ll buy a merchant ship and take command.  
 I won’t be staying with you.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Birds can show men  
 the silver treasures of their ancestors,  
 buried in the ground so long ago.  
 For birds know where these are. Men always say,                                         
> “No one knows where my treasure lies, no one,  
> except perhaps some bird.”  

EUELPIDES  
 I’ll sell my boat.                                           
 I’ll buy a spade and dig up tons of gold.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 How will we provide for human health?
 Such things dwell with the gods.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 If they’re doing well,  
 is that not giving them good health?

EUELPIDES  
You’re right.  
 A man whose business isn’t very sound  
 is never medically well.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 All right,  
 but how will they get old? That’s something, too,  
 Olympian gods bestow. Must they die young?

PISTHETAIROS  
 No, no, by god. The birds will add on years,  
 three hundred more.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 And where will those come from?                        

PISTHETAIROS  
 From the birds’ supply. You know the saying,  
 “Five human lifetimes lives the cawing crow.”[^note-136]    

EUELPIDES  
 My word, these birds are much more qualified                                                
 to govern us than Zeus.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Far better qualified!  
 First, we don’t have to build them holy shrines,  
 made out of stone, or put up golden doors  
 to decorate their sanctuaries. They live  
 beneath the bushes and young growing trees.  
 As for the prouder birds, an olive grove  
 will be their temple. When we sacrifice,                                                  
 no need to go to Ammon or to Delphi—  
 we’ll just stand among arbutus trees                                                                           
 or oleasters with an offering—  
 barley grains or wheat—uttering our prayers,  
 our arms outstretched, so from them we receive  
 our share of benefits. And these we’ll gain  
 by throwing them a few handfuls of grain.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Old man, how much you’ve been transformed for me—  
 From my worst enemy into my friend,  
 my dearest friend. These strategies of yours—                    
 I’ll not abandon them, not willingly.  

CHORUS  
 The words you’ve said make us rejoice—  
 and so we’ll swear with just one voice  
 an oath that if you stand with me—                                                                            
 our thoughts and aims in unity—  
 honest, pious, just, sincere,  
 to go against the gods up there,  
 if we’re both singing the same song  
 the gods won’t have my sceptre long.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Whatever can be done with force alone                              
 we’re ready to take on—what requires brains  
 or thinking through, all that stuff’s up to you.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 That’s right, by Zeus. No time for dozing now,                                                
 or entertaining doubts, like Nikias.[^note-137]  
 No—let’s get up and at it fast.  

TEREUS  
 But first, you must come in this nest of mine,  
 these sticks and twigs assembled here. So now,  
 both of you, tell us your names.  

PISTHETAIROS  
That’s easy.  
 My name’s Pisthetairos.  

TEREUS  
And this man here?

EUELPIDES  
 I’m Euelpides, from Crioa.                                                                                      

TEREUS  
 Welcome both of you!  

PISTHETAIROS and EUELPIDES  
 Thanks very much.  

TEREUS  
 Won’t you come in?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Let’s go. But you go first—  
 show us the way.  

TEREUS  
 Come on, then.  

[Tereus enters his house]  

PISTHETAIROS [holding back, calling into the house]  
 But . . . it’s strange . . .  
 Come back a minute.  

[Tereus reappears at the door]  

 Look, tell us both  
 how me and him can share the place with you  
 when you can fly but we’re not able to.                                                                   

TEREUS  
 I don’t see any problem there.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Maybe,  
 but in Aesop’s fables there’s a story told  
 about some fox who hung around an eagle,  
 with unfortunate results.  

TEREUS  
 Don’t be afraid.                                                  
 We have a little root you nibble on—  
 and then you’ll grow some wings.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 All right then,  
 let’s go. [To the slaves] Manodorus, Xanthias,  
 bring in our mattresses.  

CHORUS LEADER [to Tereus]  
 Hold on a second—  
 I’m calling you.  

TEREUS  
 Why are you calling me?

CHORUS LEADER  
 Take those two men in—give ‘em a good meal.  
 But bring your tuneful nightingale out here,  
 who with the Muses sings such charming songs—  
 leave her with us so we can play together.                                                            

PISTHETAIROS  
 Yes, by god—agree to their request.                                                            
 Bring out your little birdie in the reeds.  

EUELPIDES  
 For gods’ sake, bring her out, so we can see  
 this lovely nightingale of yours.  

TEREUS  
 If that’s what you both want, it must be done.  
         [calling inside]  
 Come here, Procne. Our guests are calling you.  

[Enter Procne from the house. She has a nightingale’s head and wings but the body of a young woman. 
She is wearing gold jewellery]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Holy Zeus, that’s one gorgeous little bird!  
 What a tender chick!  

EUELPIDES  
 How I’d love to help that birdie  
 spread her legs, if you catch my drift.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Look at that—  
 all the gold she’s wearing—just like a girl.                                                             

EUELPIDES  
 What I’d like to do right now is kiss her.                                                 

PISTHETAIROS  
 You idiot—look at that beak she’s got,  
 a pair of skewers.  

EUELPIDES  
 All right, by god,  
 we’ll treat her like an egg—peel off the shell,  
 take it clean off her head, and then we’ll kiss her.  

TEREUS  
 Let’s get inside.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 You lead us in—good luck to all!  

[Pisthetairos, Euelpides, Tereus, Xanthias, and Manodorusenter the house]  

CHORUS [singing to Procne]  
 Ah, my tawny throated love,  
 of all the birds that fly above  
 you’re dearest to my heart  
 your sweet melodious voice  
 in my song plays its part—                                          
 my lovely Nightingale,  
 you’ve come,                                                                                                         
 you’ve come.  
 And now youre here with me.  
 Pour forth your melody.  
 Pipe out the lovely sounds of spring,  
 a prelude to my rhythmic speech  
 in every melody you sing.  

[Procne plays on the flute for a few moments as the Chorus Leader prepares to address the audience directly. 
He steps forward getting close to the spectators]  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Come now, you men out there, who live such dark, sad lives—  
 you’re frail, just like a race of leaves—you’re shaped from clay,           
 you tribes of insubstantial shadows without wings,  
 you creatures of a day, unhappy mortal men,  
 you figures from a dream, now turn your minds to us,  
 the eternal, deathless, air-borne, ageless birds,  
 whose wisdom never dies, so you may hear from us  
 the truth about celestial things, about the birds—                                         
 how they sprang into being, how the gods arose,  
 how rivers, Chaos, and dark Erebus were formed[^note-138]    
 — about all this you’ll learn the truth. And so from me  
 tell Prodicus in future to depart.[^note-139]   At the start,                                  
 there was Chaos, and Night, and pitch-black Erebus,  
 and spacious Tartarus. There was no earth, no heaven,  
 no atmosphere. Then in the wide womb of Erebus,  
 that boundless space, black-winged Night, first creature born,  
 made pregnant by the wind, once laid an egg. It hatched,  
 when seasons came around, and out of it sprang Love—  
 the source of all desire, on his back the glitter  
 of his golden wings, just like the swirling whirlwind.  
 In broad Tartarus, Love had sex with murky Chaos.  
 From them our race was born—our first glimpse of the light.         
 Before that there was no immortal race at all,  
 not before Love mixed all things up. But once they’d bred                          
 and blended in with one another, Heaven was born,  
 Ocean and Earth—and all that clan of deathless gods.  
 Thus, we’re by far the oldest of all blessed ones,  
 for we are born from Love. There’s lots of proof for this.  
 We fly around the place, assisting those in love—  
 the handsome lads who swear they’ll never bend for sex,  
 but who, as their young charms come to an end, agree  
 to let male lovers bugger them, thanks to the birds,                      
 our power as gifts—one man gives a porphyrion,  
 another man a quail, a third one gives a goose,  
 and yet another offers up a Persian Fowl.[^note-140]  
 All mortals’ greatest benefits come from us birds.  
 The first is this: we make the season known—springtime,  
 winter, autumn—it’s time to sow, as soon as Crane  
 migrates to Lybia with all that noise. He tells                                                    
 the master mariner to hang his rudder up  
 and go to sleep awhile. He tells Orestes, too,  
 to weave himself a winter cloak, so he won’t freeze              
 when he sets out again to rip off people’s clothes.[^note-141]  
 Then after that the Kite appears, to let you know  
 another season’s here—it’s time to shear the sheep.  
 Then Swallow comes. Now you should sell your winter cloak  
 and get yourself a light one. So we’re your Ammon,  
 Delphi and Dodona—we’re your Apollo, too.[^note-142]  
 See how, in all your business, you first look to birds—  
 when you trade, buy goods, or when a man gets married.  
 Whatever you think matters in a prophecy,  
 you label that a bird—to you, Rumour’s a bird;                                               
 you say a sneeze or a chance meeting is a bird,  
 a sound’s a bird, a servant’s a bird—and so’s an ass.  
 It’s clear you look on us as your Apollo.  

CHORUS  
 So you ought to make gods of your birds,  
 your muses prophetic, whose words  
 all year round you’ve got,  
 unless it’s too hot.  
 Your questions will always be heard.  

 And we won’t run away to a cloud  
 and sit there like Zeus, who’s so proud—                             
 we’re ready to give,  
 hang out where you live,  
 and be there for you in the crowd.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Yes, to you, your children, and their children, too,                                      
 we’ll grant wealth and health, good life, and happiness,  
 peace, youth, laughter, dances, festivals of song—  
 and birds’ milk, too—so much, you’ll find yourself worn out  
 with our fine gifts—yes, that’s how rich you’ll be.  

CHORUS  
 O woodland Muse  
 Tio-tio-tio-tiotinx                                               
 my muse of varied artful song  
 on trees and from high mountain peaks                                                  
 tio-tio-tio-tiotinx  
 to your notes I sing along  
 in my leafy ash tree seat.  
 tio-tio-tio-tiontinx  
 From my tawny throat I fling  
 my sacred melodies to Pan.  
 In holy dance I chant and sing  
 our mother from the mountain land.                                          
 Toto-toto-toto-toto-toto-totinx  
 Here Phrynichus would always sip                                                                 
 ambrosial nectar from our tone  
 to make sweet music of his own.  
 tio-tio-tio-tiotinx.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 If there’s someone out there in the audience  
 who’d like to spend his future life among the birds  
 enjoying himself, he should come to us. Here, you see,  
 whatever is considered shameful by your laws,  
 is all just fine among us birds. Consider this—                    
 if your tradition says one shouldn’t beat one’s dad,  
 up here with us it’s all right if some young bird  
 goes at his father, hits him, cries, “You wanna fight?
 Then put up your spur!” If out there among you all                                      
 there is, by chance, a tattooed slave who’s run away,  
 we’ll call him a spotted francolin. Or else,  
 if someone happens to be Phrygian, as pure  
 as Spintharos, he’ll be a Philemon-bred finch.  
 If he’s like Execestides, a Carian slave,  
 let him act the Cuckoo—steal his kin from us—                  
 some group of citizens will claim him soon enough.  
 And if the son of Peisias still has in mind  
 betraying our city gates to worthless men,  
 let him become his father’s little partridge cock—  
 for us there’s nothing wrong with crafty partridge stock.  

CHORUS  
 Tio-tio-tio-tio-tinx-
 That’s how the swans                                                                                    
 massed in a crowd  
 with rustling wings  
 once raised aloud                                               
 Apollo’s hymn.  

 Tio-tio-tio-tio-tinx  
 They sat in rows  
 on river banks  
 where Hebros flows.  
 Tio-tio-tio-tio-tinx  

 Their song then rose  
 through cloud and air—  
 it cast its spell  
 on mottled tribes                                               
 of wild beasts there—  
 the silent sky  
 calmed down the sea.  
 Toto-toto-toto-toto-totinx.  

 Olympus rang—                                                                                                
 amazement seized  
 its lords and kings.  
 Then Muses there  
 and Graces, too,  
 voiced their response—                                      
 Olympus sang.  
 Tio-tio-tio-tio-tiotinx.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 There’s nothing sweeter or better than growing wings.  
 If any of you members of the audience  
 had wings, well, if you were feeling bored or hungry  
 with these tragic choruses, you could fly away,  
 go home for dinner, and then, once you’d had enough,  
 fly back to us again. Or if, by any chance,  
 a Patrocleides sits out there among you all,                                                         
 dying to shit, he wouldn’t have to risk a fart                        
 in his own pants—he could fly off and let ’er rip,  
 take a deep breath, and fly back down again.  
 If it should be the case that one of you out there  
 is having an affair, and you observe her husband  
 sitting here, in seats reserved for Council men,  
 well, once again, you could fly off and fuck the wife,  
 then fly back from her place and take your seat once more.  
 Don’t you see how having wings to fly beats everything?
 Just look at Diitrephes—the only wings he had  
 were handles on his flasks of wine, but nonetheless,                      
 they chose him to lead a squad of cavalry,  
 then for a full command, so now, from being nobody,  
 he carries out our great affairs—he’s now become                                      
 a tawny civic horse-cock.[^note-143]  

[Enter Pisthetairos and Euelpides from Tereus’ house. They now have wings on and feathers on their heads 
instead of hair}

PISTHETAIROS  
 Well, that’s that. By Zeus,  
 I’ve never seen a more ridiculous sight!  

EUELPIDES  
 What are you laughing at?

PISTHETAIROS  
 At your feathers.  
 Have you any idea what you look like—  
 what you most resemble with those feathers on?
 A goose painted by some cheap artiste!  

EUELPIDES  
 And you look like a blackbird—one whose hair                  
 has just been cut using a barber’s bowl.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 People will use us as metaphors—  
 as Aeschlyus would say, “We’re shot by feathers  
 not from someone else but of our very own.”  

CHORUS LEADER  
 All right, then. What do we now need to do?

PISTHETAIROS  
 First, we have to name our city, something  
 fine and grand. Then after that we sacrifice                                                        
 an offering to the gods.  

EUELPIDES  
 That’s my view, too.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 So what name shall we give our city?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Well, do you want to use that mighty name                        
 from Lacedaimon—shall we call it Sparta?

EUELPIDES  
 By Hercules, would I use that name Sparta  
 for my city? No. I wouldn’t even try  
 esparto grass to make my bed, not if  
 I could use cords of linen.[^note-144]  

PISTHETAIROS  
All right then, what name  
 shall we provide?

CHORUS LEADER  
Some name from around here—  
 to do with clouds, with high places full of air,  
 something really extra grand.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Well, then,  
 how do you like this: Cloudcuckooland?

CHORUS LEADER  
 Yes! That’s good! You’ve come up with a name 1090            
 that’s really wonderful—it’s great!  

EUELPIDES  
 Hang on,  
 is this Cloudcuckooland the very spot  
 where Theogenes keeps lots of money,  
 and Aeschines hides all his assets?[^note-145]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 It’s even more than that—it’s Phlegra Plain,  
 the place where gods beat up on all the giants  
 in a bragging match.[^note-146]  

EUELPIDES  
 This fine metropolis!  
 O what a glittering thing this city is!  
 Now who should be the city’s guardian god?
 Who gets to wear the sacred robes we weave?                                  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Why not let Athena do the guarding?

EUELPIDES  
 But how can we have a finely ordered state  
 where a female goddess stands there fully armed,                                        
 while Cleisthenes still fondles weaving shuttles.[^note-147]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Well, who will hold our city’s strong Storkade?

CHORUS LEADER  
 A bird among us of a Persian breed—  
 it’s said to be the fiercest anywhere  
 of all the war god’s chicks.  

EUELPIDES  
 Some princely cocks?
 They’re just the gods to live among the rocks!  

PISTHETAIROS [to Euelpides]  
 Come now, you must move up into the air,                                        
 and help the ones who’re building up the wall—  
 hoist rubble for ’em, strip and mix the mortar,  
 haul up the hod, and then fall off the ladder.                                                     
 Put guards in place, and keep all fires concealed.  
 Make your inspection rounds holding the bell.[^note-148]  
 Go to sleep up there. Then send out heralds—  
 one to gods above, one down to men below.  
 And then come back from there to me.  

EUELPIDES  
 And you?
 You’ll stay here? Well, to hell with you . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Hey, my friend,  
 you should go where I send you—without you                    
 none of that work I mentioned will get done.  
 We need a sacrifice to these new gods.  
 I’ll call a priest to organize the show.  

[Euelpides exits. Pisthetairos calls to the slaves through the doors of Tereus’ house]  

 You, boy, pick up the basket, and you,  
 my lad, grab up the holy water.                                                                                        

[Pisthetairos enters the house. As the Chorus sings, the slaves emerge and prepare for the sacrifice. 
The Chorus is accompanied by a raven playing the pipes]  

CHORUS  
 I think it’s good and I agree,  
 your notions here are fine with me,  
 a great big march with dancing throngs  
 and to the gods send holy songs,  
 and then their benefits to keep                                   
 we’ll sacrifice a baby sheep—  
 let go our cry, the Pythian shout,  
 while Chaeris plays our chorus out.  

[The Raven plays erratically on the pipe. Pisthetairos comes out of the house. He brings a priest with him, 
who is leading a small scrawny goat for the sacrifice]  

PISTHETAIROS [to the Raven]  
 Stop blowing all that noise! By Hercules,  
 what’s this? I’ve seen some strange things, heaven knows,                   
 but never this—a raven with a pipe  
 shoved up his nose. Come on, priest, work your spell,  
 and sacrifice to these new gods as well.  

PRIEST  
 I’ll do it. But where’s the basket-bearing boy?

[The slave appears with the basket]  

 Let us now pray to Hestia of the birds,[^note-149]                                                    
 and to the Kite that watches o’er the hearth,  
 to all Olympian birds and birdesses . . .  

PISTHETAIROS [to himself]  
 O Hawk of Sunium, all hail to you,  
 Lord of the Sea . . .  

PRIEST  
 And to the Pythian Swan of Delos—  
 let’s pray to Leto, mother of the quail                                                                        
 to Artemis the Goldfinch . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Ha! No more goddess  
 of Colaenis now, but goldfinch Artemis . . .  

PRIEST  
 . . . to Sabazdios, Phrygian frigate bird,  
 to the great ostrich mother of the gods                       
 and of all men . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
 . . . to Cybele, our ostrich queen,  
 mother of Cleocritos[^note-150]   . . .  

PRIEST  
 . . . may they give  
 to all Cloudcuckooites security,  
 good health, as well—and to the Chians, too.[^note-151]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 I do like that—the way those Chians                                                                           
 always get tacked on everywhere—  

PRIEST  
         . . . to Hero birds, and to their chicks,  
 to Porphyrions and Pelicans,  
 both white and grey, to Raptor-birds and Pheasants,  
 Peacocks and Warblers . . .  

[The Priest starts to get carried away]  
  
 . . . Ospreys and Teals  
 Herons and Gannets, Terns, small Tits, big Tits, and . . .  

PISTHETAIROS [interrupting]  
 Hold on, dammit—stop calling all these birds.  
 You idiot! In what sort of sacrifice                                                                                 
 does one call for ospreys and for vultures?
 Don’t you see—one kite could snatch this goat,  
 then carry it away? Get out of here,  
 you and your garlands, too. I’ll do it myself—  
 I’ll offer up this beast all on my own.  

[Pisthetairos pushes the Priest away. Exit Priest]  

CHORUS  
 Now once again I have to sing  
 a song to purify you all,  
 a holy sacred melody.                                                                                   
 The Blessed Ones I have to call—  
 but if you’re in a mood to eat  
 we just need one and not a score  
 for here our sacrificial meat                                                                                  
 is horns and hair, and nothing more.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Let us pray while we make sacrifice  
 to our feathery gods . . . [raises his eyes to sky and shuts his eyes]  

[A poet suddenly bursts on the scene reciting his verses as he enters]  

POET [reciting]  
 O Muse, in your songs sing the renown  
 of Cloudcuckooland—this happy town . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Where’d this thing come from? Tell me—who are you?                      

POET  
 Me? I’m a sweet tongued warbler of the words—  
 a nimble servant of the Muse, as Homer says.                                                  

PISTHETAIROS  
 You’re a slave and wear your hair that long?

POET  
 No, but all poets of dramatic songs  
 are nimble servants of the Muse, as Homer says.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 No doubt that’s why your nimble cloak’s so thin.  
 But, oh poet, why has thou come hither?

POET  
 I’ve been making up all sorts of splendid songs  
 to celebrate your fine Cloudcuckoolands—  
 dithyrambs and virgin songs and other tunes                      
 after the style of that Simonides.[^note-152]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 When did you compose these tunes? Some time ago?                                      

POET  
 O long long ago—yes, I’ve been singing  
 the glory of this town for years.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Look here—  
 I’ve just been making sacrifice today—  
 the day our city gets its name. What’s more,  
 it’s only now, as with a new-born child,  
 I’ve given it that name.  

POET  
 Ah yes, but Muses’ words are swift indeed—  
 like twinkling hooves on rapid steeds.  
 So thou, oh father, first of Aetna’s kings,                                                
 whose name means lots of holy things,  
 present me something from thy grace  
 whate’er you wish, just nod your face.[^note-153]                                                                     

PISTHETAIROS  
 This fellow here is going to give us trouble—  
 unless we can escape by giving something.  

[Calling one of the slaves]  

 You there with the tunic and the jerkin on.  
 Strip off the leather jerkin. Give it up  
 to this master poet. Take this jerkin.  
 You look as if you’re really freezing cold.  

POET  
 The darling Muse accepts the gift                                         
 and not unwillingly—  
 But now your wit should get a lift  
 from Pindar’s words which . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
 This fellow’s never going to go away!                                                                         

POET [making up a quotation]  
         “Out there amid nomadic Scythians,  
 he wanders from the host in all his shame,  
 he who has no woven garment shuttle-made—  
 a jerkin on, but no tunic to his name.”  
 I speak so you can understand.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Yes, I get it—you want the tunic, too.                                                        
         [To the slave] Take it off. We must assist our poets.  
 Take it and get out.  

POET  
I’m on my way—  
 But as I go I’ll still make songs like these  
 in honour of your city—  
         “O thou sitting on a golden throne,                                                                             
 sing to celebrate that shivering, quivering land.  
 I walked its snow-swept fruitful plains . . .”  

[At this point Pisthetairos has had enough. He grabs the poet and throws him into the wings]  

POET [as he exits]  
 Aaaaiiiii!  

PISTHETAIROS [calling after him]  
 Well, by Zeus, at least you’ve now put behind  
 the cold, since you’ve got that little tunic on!  
 God knows, that’s a problem I’d not thought about—              
 he learned about our city here so fast.  
 [resuming the sacrifice] Come, boy, pick up the holy water  
 and walk around again. Let everyone  
 observe a sacred holy silence now . . .  

[Enter an Oracle Monger, quickly interrupting the ceremony. He is carrying a scroll]  

ORACLE MONGER  
 Don’t sacrifice that goat!  

PISTHETAIROS  
 What? Who are you?

ORACLE MONGER  
 Who am I? I’m an oracular interpreter.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 To hell with you!                                                                                                                              

ORACLE MONGER  
Now, now, my dear good man,  
 don’t disparage things divine. You should know  
 there’s an oracle of Bacis which speaks  
 of your Cloudcuckooland—it’s pertinent.                                              

PISTHETAIROS  
 Then how come you didn’t talk to me  
 about this prophecy some time before  
 I set my city here?

ORACLE MONGER  
I could not do that—  
 powers divine held me in check.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Well, I guess  
 there’s nothing wrong in listening to it now.  

ORACLE MONGER [unrolling the scroll and reading from it]  
 “Once grey crows and wolves shall live together  
 in that space between Corinth and Sicyon . . .”  

PISTHETAIROS  
 What my connection to Corinthians?

ORACLE MONGER  
 Its Bacis’ cryptic way of saying “air.”                                                                            
 “First sacrifice to Pandora a white-fleeced ram.                              
 Whoever first comes to prophesy my words,  
 let him receive a brand new cloak and sandals.”  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Are sandals in there, too?

ORACLE MONGER [showing the scroll]  
 Consult the book.  
 “Give him the bowl, fill his hands full with offal . . .”  

PISTHETAIROS  
 The entrails? Does it says that in there?

ORACLE MONGER  
 Consult the book. “Inspired youth,  
 if thou dost complete what here I do command,  
 thou shalt become an eagle in the clouds—if not,  
 if thou will not give them me, you’ll ne’er become              
 an eagle, or a turtle dove, or woodpecker.”  

PISTHETAIROS  
 That’s all in there, as well?

ORACLE MONGER  
 Consult the book.                                                                            

PISTHETAIROS [pulling out a sheet of paper from under his tunic]  
 Your oracle is not at all like this one—  
 Apollo’s very words. I them wrote down.  
 “When an impostor comes without an invitation—  
 a cheating rogue—and pesters men at sacrifice,  
 so keen is he to taste the inner parts, well then,  
 he must be beaten hard between the ribs . . .”  

ORACLE MONGER  
 I don’t think you’re reading that.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Consult the book.  
 “Do not spare him, even if he’s way up there,                                   
 an eagle in the clouds, or if he’s Lampon  
 or great Diopeithes in the flesh.”[^note-154]  

ORACLE MONGER  
 That’s not in there, is it?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Consult the book.  
 Now, get out! To hell with you . . .  

{Pisthetairos beats the Oracle Monger off stage, hitting him with the scroll]  

ORACLE MONGER  
 Ooooh . . . poor me! [Exit]                             

PISTHETAIROS  
 Run off and do your soothsaying somewhere else!  

[Enter Meton, carrying various surveying instruments, and wearing soft leather buskin boots][^note-155]  

METON  
 I have come here among you all . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Here’s more trouble.  
 And what have you come here to do? Your scheme—  
 what’s it look like? What do you have in mind?
 Why hike up here in buskin?

METON  
 I intend  
 to measure out the air for you—dividing it                          
 in surveyed lots.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 For heaven’s sake,  
 who are you?

METON [shocked]  
 Who am I? I’m Meton—  
 famous throughout Greece and Colonus.[^note-156]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 What are these things you’ve got?

METON  
 Rods to measure air.  
 You see, the air is, in its totality,                                                                                     
 shaped like a domed pot cover . . . Thus . . . and so,  
 from up above I’ll lay my ruler . . . it bends . . . thus . . .  
 set my compass inside there . . . You see?

PISTHETAIROS  
 I don’t get it.  

METON  
 With this straight ruler here  
 I measure this, so that your circle here                                
 becomes a square—and right in the middle there  
 we have a market place, with straight highways  
 proceeding to the centre, like a star,  
 which, although circular, shines forth straight beams  
 in all directions . . . Thus . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
 This man’s a Thales[^note-157]  
 Now, Meton . . .  

METON  
What?

PISTHETAIROS  
You know I love you—                                                   
 so do as I say and head out of town.  

METON  
 Am I in peril?

PISTHETAIROS  
 It’s like in Sparta—  
 they’re kicking strangers out—lots of trouble—  
 plenty of beatings on the way through town.                                     

METON  
 You mean a revolution?

PISTHETAIROS  
 God no, not that.  

METON  
 Then what?

PISTHETAIROS  
 They’ve reached a firm decision—  
 it was unanimous—to punch out every quack.  

METON  
 I think I’d best be off.  

PISTHETAIROS  
You should, by god,  
 although you may not be in time—the blows  
 are coming thick and fast . . .  

[Pisthetairos starts hitting Meton]  

METON [running off]  
 O dear me . . . I’m in a pickle.  

[Exit Meton. Pisthetairos yells after him]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Didn’t I say that some time ago?
 Go somewhere else and do your measuring!                                                      

[Enter an Athenian Commissioner. He is carrying voting urns. He is dressed in an extravagantly official costume][^note-158]  

COMMISSIONER  
 Where are your honorary governors?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Who is this man—a Sardanapallos?[^note-159]                                                            

COMMISSIONER  
 I have come here to Cloudcuckooland  
 as your Commissioner—I was picked by lot.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 As Commissioner? Who sent you here?

COMMISSIONER  
 Some dreadful paper from that Teleas.[^note-160]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 How’d you like to receive your salary  
 and leave, without doing anything?

COMMISSIONER  
 By god,  
 that would be nice. I should be staying at home  
 for the assembly. I’ve been doing some work  
 on Pharnakes’ behalf.[^note-161]  

PISTHETAIROS  
Then take your fee  
 and go. Here’s what you get . . . [strikes him]  

COMMISSIONER  
 What was that?                                                     

PISTHETAIROS  
 A motion on behalf of Pharnakes.                                                                                

[Pisthetairos strikes him again]  

COMMISSIONER  
 I call on witnesses—he’s hitting me—  
 He can’t do that—I’m a Commissioner!  

[Exit the Commissioner, on the run. Pisthetairos chases him]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Piss off! And take your voting urns with you!  
 Don’t you find it weird? Already they’ve sent out  
 Commissioners to oversee the city,  
 before we’ve made the gods a sacrifice.  

[Enter a Statute-Seller reading from a long scroll]  

STATUTE SELLER  
         “If a resident of Cloudcuckooland  
 should wrong a citizen of Athens . . .”  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Here come scrolls again—what’s the trouble now?                      

STATUE SELLER  
 I’m a statute seller—and I’ve come here  
 to sell you brand-new laws.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 What laws?

STATUTE SELLER  
Like this—  
 “Residents of Cloudcuckooland must use                                                               
 the same weights and measures and currency  
 as those in Olophyxia.”[^note-162]  

PISTHETAIROS [kicking him in the bum]  
 Soon enough  
 you’ll use them on your ass, you Fix-your-Holean!!  

STATUTE SELLER  
 What’s up with you?

PISTHETAIROS  
Take your laws and shove off!  
 Today I’ll give you laws you really feel!  

[Statute Seller runs off. The Commissioner enters from the other side, behind Pisthetairos]  

COMMISSIONER [reading from a paper]  
 “I summon Pisthetairos to appear in court  
 in April on a charge of official outrage . . .”                                         

PISTHETAIROS [turning]  
 Really? You again! Why are you still here?

[Pisthetairos chases the Commissioner off again. The Statute Seller then re-appears on the other side, 
also reading from a paper]  

STATUTE SELLER  
 “If anyone chases off court officers  
 and won’t receive them as the law decrees . . .”                                               

PISTHETAIROS [turning]  
 This is getting really bad—you still here?

[Pisthetairos chases off the Statute Seller. The Commissioner re-appears on the other side of the stage]  

COMMISSIONER  
 I’ll ruin you! I’ll take you to court—  
 ten thousand drachmas you’ll . . .  

PISTHETAIROS: [turning and chasing the Commissioner off stage]  
 And I’ll throw out those voting urns of yours!  

STATUTE SELLER [reappearing]  
 Have you any memory of those evenings  
 when you used to shit on public pillars  
 where our laws are carved?                                                                                    

[The Statute Seller turns his back on Pisthetairos, lifts up his tunic, and farts at him]  

PISTHETAIROS [reacting to the smell]  
 Oh god! Someone grab him.  

[The slaves try to catch the Statute Seller but he runs off. Pisthetairos calls after him]  

 Not going to stick around?
[to slaves] Let’s get out of here—and fast. Go inside.  
We’ll sacrifice the goat to the gods in there.  

[Pisthetairos and the slaves to inside the house]  

CHORUS  
 All mortal men commencing on this day  
 at every shrine will sacrifice to me,  
 from now on offering me the prayers they say,                                               
 for I control them all and everything I see.  
 I watch the entire world, and I protect  
 the growing crops, for I have power to kill  
 the progeny of all the world’s insects,                                                        
 whose all-devouring jaws would eat their fill  
 of what bursts out from seeds on ground below,  
 or fruit above for those who lodge in trees.  
 I kill the ones who, as the greatest foe,  
 in sweet-smelling gardens cause great injuries  
 All living beasts that bite and crawl  
 are killed—my wings destroy them all.                                                                    

CHORUS LEADER  
 This public notice has been proclaimed today:  
 the man who kills Diagoras the Melian  
 will receive one talent—and if one of you                           
 assassinates some tyrant long since dead and gone,  
 he, too, will get one talent. So now, the birds, as well,  
 wish to make the same announcement here. Anyone  
 who kills Philocrates the Sparrowman will get  
 one talent—and if he brings him in alive,  
 he’ll get four.[^note-163]   That man strings finches up together,  
 then sells ‘em—a single obol gets you seven.  
 He injures thrushes by inflating them with air                                                  
 then puts them on display. And he stuff feathers  
 up the blackbird’s nose. He captures pigeons, too,                      
 keeps them locked up, and forces them to work for him,  
 tied up as decoy birds, underneath his nets.  
 We wish to make this known to you. If anyone  
 is keeping birds in cages in your courtyards,  
 we tell you, “Let them go.” If you don’t obey,  
 you, in your turn, will be arrested by the birds,  
 tied up and forced to work as decoys where we live.  

CHORUS  
 O happy tribes  
 of feathered birds—  
 we never need                                                             
 a winter cloak.                                                                                                                    
 In summer days  
 the sun’s far rays  
 don’t injure us.  
 I live at ease  
 among the leaves  
 in flowery fields.  
 In love with sun  
 cicadas sing  
 through noonday heat                                                 
 their sharp-toned song  
 divinely sweet.  
 In winter caves  
 and hollow spots  
 I play all day  
 with mountain nymphs.  
 In spring we eat  
 white myrtle buds,  
 our virgin treat,  
 in garden places                                                          
 of the Graces.                                                                                                                       

CHORUS LEADER  
 We want to speak to all the judges here  
 about our victory—the splendid things  
 we’ll give them if their verdict goes our way—  
 how they’ll get much lovelier gifts than those  
 which Alexander got.[^note-164]   And first of all,  
 what every judge is really keen to have,  
 some owls of Laureium who’ll never leave.[^note-165]  
 They’ll nest inside your homes, hatch in your purse,  
 and always breed small silver change. And then,                           
 as well as this, you’ll live in temple-homes.  
 The birds will make your roof tops eagle-style,                                                
 with pediments.[^note-166]   If you hold some office,  
 a minor post, and wish to get rich quick,  
 we’ll set a sharp-beaked falcon in your hands.  
 And if you need to eat, then we’ll dispatch  
 a bird’s crop, where it keep its stored-up food.  
 If you don’t vote for us, you should prepare  
 some little metal plates to guard your head.  
 You’ll need to wear them, just like statues do.                                  
 For those of you without that head plate on,        
 when you dress up in fine white brand-new clothes,  
 the birds will crap on as a punishment.  

[Enter Pisthetairos from the house]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 You birds, we’ve made a splendid sacrifice.  
 But why is there still no messenger  
 arriving from the walls to bring us news                                                                 
 of what’s going on up there? Ah, here comes one,  
 panting as if he’d run across that stream  
 at Elis where Olympian athletes race.  

[Enter First Messenger, out of breath]  

FIRST MESSENGER [he doubles up and can hardly speak]  
 Where is . . . Where is he . . . where . . . where is . . .                      
 where . . . where . . . where . . . our governor Pisthetairos?

PISTHETAIROS  
 I’m here.  

FIRST MESSENGER  
 The building of your wall . . . it’s done.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 That’s great news.  

FIRST MESSENGER  
 The result—the best there is . . .  
 the most magnificent . . . so wide across . . .  
 that Proxenides of Braggadocio  
 and Theogenes could drive two chariots  
 in opposite directions past each other  
 along the top, with giant horses yoked,  
 bigger than that wooden horse at Troy.  

PISTHETAIROS [genuinely surprised]  
 By Hercules!  

FIRST MESSENGER  
 I measured it myself— 1450            
 its height—around six hundred feet.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Wow!  
 By Poseidon, that’s some height! Who built the wall  
 as high as that?

FIRST MESSENGER  
 The birds—nobody else.  
 No Egyptian bore the bricks—no mason,  
 no carpenter was there. They worked by hand—  
 I was amazed. Thirty thousand cranes flew in  
 from Lybia—they brought foundation stones  
 they’d swallowed down. The corn crakes chipped away  
 to form the proper shapes. Ten thousand storks  
 brought bricks. Lapwings and other river birds                    
 fetched water up into the air from down below.                                             

PISTHETAIROS  
 Who hauled the mortar up there for them?

FIRST MESSENGER  
 Herons—  
 they carried hods.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 How’d they load those hods?

FIRST MESSENGER  
 My dear man, that was the cleverest thing of all.  
 Geese shoved their feet into the muck and slid them,  
 just like shovels, then flicked it in the hods.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Is there anything we can’t do with our feet?

FIRST MESSENGER: Then, by god, the ducks, with slings attached  
 around their waists, set up the bricks. Behind them  
 flew the swallows, like young apprentice boys, 1470            
 with trowels—they carried mortar in their mouths.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Why should we hire wage labour any more?
 Go on—who finished off the woodwork on the wall?

FIRST MESSENGER  
 The most skilled craftsmen-birds of all of ‘em—  
 woodpeckers. They pecked away to make the gates—  
 the noise those peckers made—an arsenal!  
 Now the whole thing has gates. They’re bolted shut  
 and guarded on all sides. Sentries make rounds,  
 patrolling with their bells, and everywhere                                                          
 troops are in position, with signal fires                                
 on every tower. But I must go now—  
 I need to wash. You’ll have to do the rest.  

[Exit First Messenger]  

CHORUS LEADER  
 What’s up with you? Aren’t you astonished  
 to hear the wall’s been finished up so fast?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Yes, by gods, I am. It is amazing!  
 To me it sounds just like some made-up lie.  
 But here comes a guard from there—he’ll bring news  
 to us down here of what’s going on up top.  
 He face looks like a dancing warrior’s.  

[Enter the Second Messenger in a great panic and out of breath]  

SECOND MESSENGER  
 Hey . . . hey . . . Help . . . hey you . . . help! 1490            

PISTHETAIROS  
 What’s going on?

SECOND MESSENGER  
We suffered something really bad . . .  
 one of the gods from Zeus has just got through,  
 flown past the gates into the air, slipping by  
 the jackdaw sentinels on daytime watch.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 That’s bad! A bold and dangerous action.  
 Which god was it?

SECOND MESSENGER  
We’re not sure. He had wings—  
 we do know that.  

PISTHETAIROS  
You should have sent patrols  
 of frontier guards out after him without delay.  

SECOND MESSENGER  
 We did dispatch the mounted archers—  
 thirty thousand falcons, all moving out 1500            
 with talons curved and ready—kestrels, buzzards,  
 vultures, eagles, owls—the air vibrating  
 with the beat and rustle of their wings,  
 as they search out that god. He’s not far off—  
 in fact, he’s here somewhere already.  

[Exit Second Messenger]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 We’ll have to get our sling-shots out—and bows.  
 All you orderlies come here! Fire away!  
 Strike out! Someone fetch a sling for me!  

[Xanthias and Manodorus enter with slings and bows. The group huddles together with weapons ready]  

CHORUS [in grand epic style]  
 And now the combat starts, a strife beyond all words,  
 me and the gods at war. Let everyone beware, 1510             
 protect the cloud-enclosing air, which Erebus  
 gave birth to long ago. Make sure no god slips through  
 without our catching sight of him. Maintain your watch  
 on every side—already I can hear close by  
 the sound of beating wings from some god in the sky.  

[Enter Iris, in long billowing dress and with a pair of wings. She descends from above, suspended by 
a cable and hovering in mid-air flapping her wings]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Hey, you—just where do you think you’re flying?
 Keep still. Stay where you are. Don’t move. Stop running.                               
 Who are you? Where you from? You’ve got to tell me.  
 Where’d you come from?

IRIS  
 I’m from the Olympian gods.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 You got a name? You look like a ship up there—                
 the Salaminia or the Paralos.[^note-167]  

IRIS  
 I’m fast Iris.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Fast as in a boat or fast as in a bitch?

IRIS  
 What is all this?

PISTHETAIROS  
Is there a buzzard here  
 who’ll fly up there to arrest this woman?

IRIS  
 Arrest me? Why are you saying such rubbish?

PISTHETAIROS [making at attempt to hit Iris by swinging his sling]  
 You’re going to be very sorry about this.  

IRIS  
 This whole affair is most unusual.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Listen, you silly old fool, what gates  
 did you pass through to get by the wall?

IRIS  
 What gates?
 By god, I don’t have the least idea. 1530            

PISTHETAIROS  
 Listen to her—how she feigns ignorance!  
 Did you go past the jackdaw generals?
 You won’t answer that? Well then, where’s your pass,  
 the one the storks give out?

IRIS  
 What’s wrong with you?

PISTHETAIROS  
 You don’t have one, do you?

IRIS  
 Have you lost your wits?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Didn’t some captain of the birds up there  
 stick a pass on you?

IRIS  
 By god no, no one up there  
 made a pass or shoved his stick at me, you wretch.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 So you just fly in here, without a word,  
 going through empty space and through a city                    
 which don’t belong to you?

IRIS  
 What other route  
 are gods supposed to fly?

PISTHETAIROS  
I’ve no idea.  
 But, by god, not this way. It’s not legal.                                                                   
 Right now you’re in breach of law. Do you know,  
 of all the Irises there are around,  
 if you got what you most deserve, you’d be  
 the one most justly seized and sent to die.  

IRIS  
 But I’m immortal.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 In spite of that,  
 you would have died. For it’s obvious to me  
 that we’d be suffering the greatest injury,                                              
 if, while we rule all other things, you gods  
 do just what you like and won’t recognize  
 how you must, in your turn, attend upon  
 those more powerful than you. So tell me,  
 where are you sailing on those wings of yours?

IRIS  
 Me? I’m flying to men from father Zeus,                                                                
 instructing them to sacrifice some sheep  
 to the Olympian gods on sacred hearths—  
 and fill their streets with smells of offerings.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Who are you talking about? Which gods?                                              

IRIS  
 Which gods? Why us of course—the gods in heaven.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 And you’re the gods?

IRIS  
 Are there any other deities?

PISTHETAIROS  
 The birds are now men’s gods—and to the birds  
 men must now sacrifice and not, by god, to Zeus.  

IRIS [in the grand tragic style]  
 Thou fool, thou fool, stir not the awesome minds of gods,  
 lest Justice with the mighty mattock of great Zeus                                        
 destroy your race completely—and smoke-filled flames  
 from Licymnian lightning bolts burn into ash  
 your body and your home . . .  

PISTHETAIROS [interrupting]  
 Listen, woman—stop your spluttering.  
 Just keep still. Do you think you’re scaring off                    
 some Lydian or Phrygian with such threats?
 You should know this—if Zeus keeps on annoying me,  
 I’ll burn his home and halls of Amphion,  
 reduce them all to ash with fire eagles.  
 I’ll send more than six hundred birds—porphyrions  
 all dressed in leopard skins, up there to heaven,                                            
 to war on him. Once a single porphyrion  
 caused him distress enough.[^note-168]   And as for you,  
 if you keep trying to piss me off, well then,  
 I’ll deal with Zeus’ servant Iris first—                                   
 I’ll fuck your knickers off—you’d be surprised  
 how hard an old man’s prick like mine can be—  
 it’s strong enough to ram your hull three times.  

IRIS  
 Blast you, you wretch, and your obscenities!  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Go way! Get a move on! Shoo!  

[Iris begins to move up and away]  

IRIS  
 My father  
 won’t stand for insolence like this—he’ll stop you!  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Just go away, you silly fool! Fly off                                                                                
 and burn someone to ashes somewhere else.  

[Exit Iris]  

CHORUS  
 On Zeus’ family of gods we’ve shut our door—  
 they’ll not be passing through my city any more.                          
 Nor will men down below in future time invoke  
 the gods by sending them their sacrificial smoke.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Something’s wrong. That messenger we sent,  
 the one that went to human beings, what if  
 he never gets back here again?                                                                                         

[Enter First Herald, a bird, carrying a golden crown]  

FIRST HERALD  
 O Pisthetairos, you blessed one,  
 wisest and most celebrated of all men . . .  
 the cleverest and happiest . . . trebly blest . . .        
         [He’s run out of adjectives] . . . Speak something to me . . .  

 PISTHETAIROS  
What are you saying?

FIRST HERALD [offering Pisthetairos the golden crown]  
 All people, in honour of your wisdom,                                                     
 crown you with this golden diadem.  

PISTHETAIROS [putting on the crown]  
 I accept.  
 But why do people honour me so much?

FIRST HERALD  
 O you founder of this most famous town,  
 this city in the sky, do you not know  
 how much respect you have among all men,  
 how many men there are who love this place?
 Before you built your city in the air,                                                                            
 all men were mad for Sparta—with long hair,  
 they went around half starved and never washed,  
 like Socrates—and carrying knobbed sticks.                                       
 But now they’ve all completely changed—these days  
 they’re crazy for the birds. For sheer delight  
 they imitate the birds in everything.  
 Early in the day when they’ve just got up,  
 like us, they all flock to feed together,  
 but on their laws, browsing legal leaflets,  
 nibbling their fill of all decrees. So mad  
 have they become for birds that many men                                                        
 have had the names of birds assigned to them.  
 One lame tradesman now is called the Partridge.                         
 And Melanippus’ name is changed to Swallow,[^note-169]  
 Opuntius the Raven with One Eye.  
 Philocles becomes the Lark, and Sheldrake  
 is now Teagenes’ name. Lycurgus  
 has become the Ibis, Chaerephon the Bat,  
 Syracosius the Jay, and Meidias  
 is now named the Quail—he looks like one  
 right after the quail flicker’s tapped its head.[^note-170]  
 They’re so in love with birds they all sing songs                                              
 with lines about a swallow or a duck,                                                         
 or goose, some kind of pigeon, or just wings,  
 even about some tiny bits of feather.  
 That what’s going on down there. I tell you,  
 more than ten thousand men are coming here,  
 demanding wings and talons in their lives.  
 You’ve got to find a way to get some wings  
 for your new colonists and settlers.  

[Exit First Herald]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 All right, by god, this is no time for us  
 to just stand around. [To a slave] You, get inside there—  
 fill all the crates and baskets up with feathers.1640            
 Get on with it as fast as possible.  
 Let Manes haul the wings out here to me.[^note-171]  
 I’ll welcome those who come from down below.  

[Xanthias and Manodoros go inside the house and start bringing out baskets of feathers]  

CHORUS  
 Our city soon will have a reputation  
 for a large and swelling population.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Just let our luck hold out!  

CHORUS  
 Our city here inspires so much love . . .  

PISTHETAIROS [to Manodoros, who is bringing out a basket]  
 I’m telling you you’ve got to bring it fast!  

CHORUS  
 For what do we not have here up above  
 which any men require in their places?                                                    
 Desire, Wisdom, and eternal Graces—  
 we’ve got them all and what is still the best—  
 the happy face of gentle peaceful Rest.  

PISTHETAIROS [to Manes who is taking his time bringing out more baskets]  
 God, you’re a lazy slave—move it! Faster!  

CHORUS  
 Let him bring the wings in baskets on the go—  
 then once more run at him—give him a blow.  
 The lad is like a donkey—he’s that slow.  

PISTHETAIROS [frantically sorting feathers]  
 Yes, that Manes is a useless slave.  

CHORUS  
 Now first of all you need to sort                                                                                      
 these wings all out for each cohort—                                   
 musical wings and wings of seers,  
 wings for the sea. You must be clear—  
 you need to look at all such things  
 when you give every man his wings.  

[Manes comes out with a basket, again moving very slowly]  

PISTHETAIROS [going at Manes and grabbling him]  
 By the kestrels, I can’t stop grabbing you—  
 when I see how miserably slow you are.  

[Manes twists loose and runs back into the house. A young man enters singing]  

YOUNG MAN [singing]  
 Oh, I wish I could an eagle be  
 soaring high above the barren sea,  
 the grey-blue ocean swell so free.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 It looks like our messenger told us the truth—                    
 here comes someone singing that eagle-song.  

YOUNG MAN  
 Damn it—there’s nothing in the world as sweet  
 as flying . . .  

<PISTHETAIROS  
 You’ve come to get some wings from us, I guess.[^note-172]  >

YOUNG MAN  
 Yes, I’m in love with all your birdy ways—  
 I want to live with you and fly. Besides,  
 I think your laws are really keen.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 What laws? The birds have many laws.  

YOUNG MAN  
 All of them—but I really like that one  
 which says it’s all right for a younger bird  
 to beat up his old man and strangle him.                                               

PISTHETAIROS  
 Yes, by god, we think it very manly  
 when a bird, while still a chick, beats up his dad.                                           

YOUNG MAN  
 That’s why I want to re-locate up here—  
 I’d love to choke my father, get all his stuff.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 But there’s an ancient law among the birds—  
 inscribed in stone on tablets of the storks,  
         “When father stork has raised up all his young,  
 when they are set to fly out of the nest,  
 then young storks must, in their turn, care for him.”  

YOUNG MAN  
 So coming here has been no use, by god,                                              
 if I’ve now got to feed my father, too.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 No, no. My dear young man, since you came here                                      
 in all good faith, I’ll fix you up with wings  
 just like an orphan bird.[^note-173]   And I’ll give you  
 some fresh advice—something I learned myself  
 when I was just a lad. Don’t thump your dad.  

[Pisthetairos starts dressing the boy as a bird as he says the following lines]  

 Take this wing here, and in your other hand  
 hold this spur tight. Think of this crest on top  
 as from a fighting cock. Then stand your guard,  
 go on a march, live on a soldier’s pay—                              
 and let your father live. You like to fight,  
 so fly away to territories in Thrace,  
 and do your fighting there.  

YOUNG MAN  
 By Dionysus,  
 I think the advice you give is good.                                                                              
 I’ll do just what you say.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 And now, by Zeus,  
 you’re talking sense.  

[Exit Young Man. Enter Cinesias, singing and dancing very badly][^note-174]  

CINESIAS [singing]   
 To Olympus on high  
with my wings I will fly—  
On this song’s path I’ll soar  
and then sing a few more . . .                                

PISTHETAIROS  
 This creature needs a whole pile of wings!  

CINESIAS [singing]   
 For my body and mind  
 know not fear, so I’ll find . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Cinesias, welcome. Let me now greet  
 a man as thin as bark on linden trees!  
 Why have you come whirling here on such lame feet?

CINESIAS  
 A bird—that’s what I long to be,                                                        
 a clear-voice nightingale—that’s me.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Stop singing—just tell me what you want to say.  

CINESIAS  
 I want you to give me wings then float up,                                           
 flying high into the clouds where I can pluck  
 wind-whirling preludes swept with snow.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 You want to get your preludes from the clouds?

CINESIAS  
 But all our skill depends upon the clouds.  
 Our brilliant dithyrambs are made of air—  
 of mist and gleaming murk and wispy wings.  
 You’ll soon see that—once you’ve heard a few.                                               

PISTHETAIROS  
 No, no—I won’t.  

CINESIAS  
 Yes, by Hercules, you will.  
For you I’ll run through all the airs . . . [starts singing]  

 O you images of birds,                                                                                               
 who extend your wings,  
 who tread upon the air,  
 you long-necked birds . . .  

PISTHETAIROS [trying to interrupt]  
 All right. Enough!  

CINESIAS [ignoring Pisthetairos, continuing to sing another song]  
 Soaring upward as I roam.  
 I wander floating on the breeze . . .  

PISTHETAIROS [looking in one of the baskets of wings]  
 By heaven, I’ll stop these blasting winds of yours!  

[Pisthetairos takes a pair of wings and starts poking Cinesiasaround the stage with them, tickling him]  

CINESIAS [dodging away from Pisthetairos, giggling, and continuing to sing]  
 First I head along the highway going down south,  
 but then my body turns towards the windy north,  
 as I slice airy furrows where no harbour lies . . . 1740            

[Cinesias has to stop singing because Pisthetairos is tickling him too much with the wings. 
He stops running off and singing. He’s somewhat out of breath]  

 Old man, that’s a clever trick—pleasant, too—  
 but really clever.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 You mean you don’t enjoy  
 being whisked with wings?

CINESIAS  
 Is that the way you treat  
 the man who trains the cyclic choruses—  
 the one whom tribes of men still fight to have?[^note-175]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Would you like to stick around this place  
 to train a chorus here for Leotrophides,[^note-176]  
 made up of flying birds—the swallow tribe?

CINESIAS  
 You’re making fun of me—that’s obvious.  
 But I won’t stop here until I get some wings                        
 and I can run through all the airs.  

[Exit Cinesias. Enter a Sycophant, singing to himself]  

SYCOPHANT [singing]  
 Who are these birds with mottled wing?                                                                
 They don’t appear to own a thing—  
 O dappled swallow with extended wing . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
 This is no minor problem we’ve stirred up—  
 here comes one more person singing to himself.  

SYCOPHANT [singing]  
 O long and dappled wings, I call once more . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
 It seems to me his song’s about his cloak—  
 he needs a lot of swallows to bring in the spring.[^note-177]  

SYCOPHANT  
 Where’s the man who’s handing out the wings                    
 to all who travel here?

PISTHETAIROS  
 He’s standing here.  
 But you should tell me what you need.  

SYCOPHANT  
 Wings, wings.  
 I need wings. Don’t ask me that again.                                                                    

PISTHETAIROS  
 Do you intend to fly off right away,  
 heading for Pellene?

SYCOPHANT  
 No, not at all.    
 I’m a summons server for the islands—  
 an informer, too . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
 You’re a lucky man  
 to have such a fine profession.  

SYCOPHANT  
 . . . and I hunt around  
 to dig up law suits. That’s why I need wings,  
 to roam around delivering summonses                               
 in allied states.  

PISTHETAIROS  
If you’re equipped with wings,  
 will that make you more skilled in serving men?

SYCOPHANT  
 No. But I’d escape being hurt by pirates.  
 And then I could return home with the cranes,  
 once I’ve swallowed many law suits down  
 to serve as ballast.[^note-178]  

PISTHETAIROS  
Is that what you do for work?                                         
 Tell me this—you’re a strong young lad and yet  
 don’t you slander strangers for a living?

SYCOPHANT  
 What can I do? I never learned to dig.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 But, by god, there are other decent jobs,                                                
 where a young man like you can earn his way,  
 more honest trades than launching still more law suits.  

SYCOPHANT  
 My good man, don’t keep lecturing me like this.  
 Give me some wings.  

PISTHETAIROS  
I’m giving you some wings—      
 I’m doing it as I talk to you right now.  

SYCOPHANT  
 How can you put wings on men with words?

PISTHETAIROS  
 With words all men can give themselves their wings.  

SYCOPHANT  
 All men?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Have you never heard in barber shops  
 how fathers always talk of their young sons—                                                  
 “It’s dreadful the way that Diitrephes’ speech                      
 has given my young lad ambitious wings,  
 so now he wants to race his chariot.”  
 Another says “That boy of mine has wings  
 and flutters over tragedies.”  

SYCOPHANT  
 So with words  
 they’re really given wings?

PISTHETAIROS  
 That what I said.  
 With words our minds are raised—a man can soar.  
 That’s how I want to give you wings—with words,  
 with useful words, so you can change your life  
 and get a lawful occupation.  

SYCOPHANT  
 But I don’t want to.                                                              

PISTHETAIROS  
 What will you do?

SYCOPHANT  
I’ll not disgrace my folks.                                    
 Informing—that’s my family’s profession.  
 So give me now some light, fast falcon’s wings—  
 or kestrel’s—then I can serve my papers  
 on those foreigners, lay the charges here,  
 and fly back there again.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Ah, I get it—  
 what you’re saying is that the case is judged  
 before the stranger gets here.  

SYCOPHANT  
 That’s right.  
 You understand exactly what I do.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 And then, while he’s travelling here by ship,  
 you fly out there to seize his property.                                                      

SYCOPHANT  
 You’ve said it all. I’ve got to whip around                                                              
 just like a whirling top.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 I understand—  
 a whirling top. Well, here, by god, I’ve got  
 the finest wings. They’re from Corcyra . . . here!  

[Pisthetairos produces a whip from the basket and begins hitting the Sycophant, who dodges around to evade the blows]  

SYCOPHANT  
 Ouch! That’s a whip you’ve got!  

PISTHETAIROS  
No—a pair of wings.  
 With them I’ll make you spin around all day!  

SYCOPHANT  
 Ow! Help! That hurts!  

PISTHETAIROS  
Wing your way from here!  
 Get lost—I want rid of you, you rascal!  
 I’ll show you legal tricks and twists—sharp ones, too!  

[Pisthetairos beats the Sycophant off stage. Enter Xanthiasand Manodorus from the house]  

 Let’s gather up these wings and go inside.                                             

[Pisthetairos and the two slaves carry the baskets of wings back into the house]  

CHORUS:  
When we fly                                                                                                                             
we often spy  
strange amazing spots—  
in those flights  
peculiar sights.  

 There’s a tree grows far from us  
 simply called Cleonymos,  
 a useless tree, without a heart—  
 immense, and vile in every part.  
 It always blooms in early spring,                                                                     
 bursting forth with everything  
 that launches legal quarrelling.  
 and then in winter time it yields                                                                                     
 a shedding foliage of shields.  

 There’s a land  
 ringed by the dark,  
 a gloomy wilderness,  
 where Heroes meet  
 and with men eat.  

 Men live with heroes in that place,                                                               
 except at dusk—then it’s not safe  
 for the two of them to meet.  
 Men who in the night time greet                                                                                    
 the great Orestes are stripped bare  
 he strikes at them and leaves them there.  
 And so without their clothes they bide—  
 paralysed on their right side.[^note-179]  

[Enter Prometheus, muffling his face in a long scarf and holding an unopened umbrella]  

PROMETHEUS  
 Oh, dear, dear, dear. I pray Zeus doesn’t see me.  
 Where’s Pisthetairos?

[Pisthetairos enters from the house carrying a chamber pot. He is surprised to see the new arrival]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Who’s this? Why so muffled?

PROMETHEUS  
 Do you see any god who’s trailed me here?                                         

PISTHETAIROS  
 No, by Zeus, I don’t. But who are you?

PROMETHEUS  
 What time of day is it?

PISTHETAIROS  
 What time of day?
 A little after noon. But who are you?

PROMETHEUS  
 Quitting time or later?                                                                                                              

PISTHETAIROS  
 You’re pissing me off . . .  

PROMETHEUS  
 What’s Zeus up to? What about the clouds—  
 is he scattering ‘em—or bringing ‘em together?

PISTHETAIROS  
 You’re a total fool!  

PROMETHEUS  
 All right—then I’ll unwrap.  

[Prometheus takes off the muffler concealing his face]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Prometheus, my friend!  

PROMETHEUS  
Hey, quiet. Don’t shout.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 What’s the matter?

PROMETHEUS  
 Shhh . . . don’t shout my name.  
 I’m done for if Zeus can see I’m here.                                                        
 But I’ll tell you what’s going on up there,  
 if you take this umbrella. Hold it up,  
 above our heads—that way no god can see.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Ah ha! Now that’s a smart precaution—                                                                  
 that’s forethought, just like Prometheus!  
 Come under here—make it fast—all right, now,  
 you can talk without a worry.  

[Pisthetairos and Prometheus huddle together under the umbrella]  

PROMETHEUS  
 Then listen.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 I’m listening—speak up.  

PROMETHEUS  
 Zeus is done for.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 And when was he done in?

PROMETHEUS  
 It happened  
 once you colonized the air. From that point on,                            
 no human being has made a sacrifice  
 to any god, not once—and since that time  
 no savoury smells from roasting thigh bones  
 have risen up to us from down below.  
 So now, without our offerings, we must fast,  
 as if it’s time for Thesmophoria.[^note-180]  
 The barbarian gods are starving—so now                                                              
 they scream out like Illyrians and say  
 their armies will march down attacking Zeus,  
 unless he moves to get the ports re-opened,                                       
 to make sliced entrails once again available.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 You mean other gods, barbarian ones,  
 are there above you?

PROMETHEUS  
 Barbarian deities? Of course.  
 That’s where Execestides derives  
 all his ancestral family gods.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 What’s the name of these barbarian gods?

PROMETHEUS  
 The name? They’re called Triballians.[^note-181]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 I see—that must be where we get our phrase  
 they’ve got me “by the balls.”                                                                                             

PROMETHEUS  
 You got that right.  
 Now let me tell you something to the point—                     
 ambassadors are coming here to settle this,  
 from Zeus and those Triballians up there.  
 But don’t agree to peace unless great Zeus  
 gives back his sceptre to the birds again,  
 and gives the Princess to you as your wife.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Whose this Princess?

PROMETHEUS  
 The loveliest of girls—  
 she’s the one in charge of Zeus’ thunderbolt  
 and all his assets—wise advice, good laws,  
 sound common sense, dockyards, slanderous talk—                                      
 his paymistress who hands three obols out                          
 to jury men . . .  

PISTHETAIROS  
 So in Zeus’ name,  
 she’s the one in charge of everything?

PROMETHEUS  
 That’s right.  
 If you get her from Zeus, you’ve got it all.  
 That’s why I came here to tell you this.  
 I’ve always been a friend of human beings.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Yes, of all the gods it’s thanks to you  
 that we can fry up fish.[^note-182]  

PROMETHEUS  
 I hate all gods—  
 but you know that.  

PISTHETAIROS  
You’ve always hated them.  
 Heaven knows—it’s something natural to you.  

PROMETHEUS  
 I’m Timon through and through.[^note-183]   Time to get back.                      
 So let me have the parasol. That way,  
 if Zeus does catch sight of me from there,  
 he’ll think I’m following some basket girl.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Take the piss pot, too—then you can act  
 as if you’re the one who’s carrying the stool.  

[Prometheus leaves with the umbrella and the pot. Pisthetairos goes back into the house]  

CHORUS  
 By that tribe of men with such huge feet  
 they use them for a shade retreat,  
 there’s stands a lake where Socrates,  
 deceives men’s souls, that unwashed tease.  
 Peisander went there to find out                                         
 the spirit his life had been without.  
 A big young camel he did slay,                                                                                          
 then, like Odysseus, snuck away.  
 By camel’s blood to that place drawn,  
 up pops a Bat—it’s Chaerephon![^note-184]  

[Enter Poseidon, Hercules, and the Triballian god]  

POSEIDON  
 Here it is—Cloudcuckooland—in plain view,  
 city we’ve come to as ambassadors.  

[Poseidon inspects the clothing on the Triballian god]  

 What are you doing? Why drape your cloak that way,  
 from right to left? It’s got to be re-slung  
 the other way—like this.  

[The Triballian tries to reshape his cloak but gets in a mess]  

 You fumbling idiot—                       
 a born Laespodias, that’s what you are![^note-185]  
 O democracy! Where are you taking us,                                                                 
 when gods vote in a clumsy oaf like this?

[Poseidon continues to fuss over the Triballian’s appearance]  

 Keep your hands still! Oh, to hell with you!  
 You’re the most uncivilized of all the gods  
 I’ve ever seen. All right, Hercules,  
 what do we do?

HERCULES  
 You’ve heard what I propose.  
 I’d like to wring his neck—whoever he is  
 who set up this blockade against the gods.  

POSEIDON  
 But you forget, my friend, that we’ve been sent                  
 as envoys to negotiate down here.  

HERCULES  
 That just makes me want to throttle him  
 twice as much as I wanted to before.  

[The wall of the house now moves off to reveal Pisthetairos and the slaves getting dinner ready. 
They are preparing birds to cook in the oven]  

PISTHETAIROS  
 The grater for the cheese—can someone get it?
 And bring the silphium. Hand me the cheese.  
 Now, fire up the coals.                                                                                                               

POSEIDON  
 Greetings, mortal.  
 We three are gods, and we salute you!  

PISTHETAIROS  
 But I’m grating silphium right now.  

HERCULES  
 What kind of meat is this?

PISTHETAIROS  
 The meat’s from birds—  
 they’ve been tried and sentenced for rebellion,                              
 rising up against the fowl democracy.  

HERCULES  
 Is that why you’re shredding silphium  
 all over them before doing something else?

PISTHETAIROS [looking up and recognizing Hercules]  
 Well, hello there, Hercules. What’s up?

POSEIDON  
 We’ve come as envoys sent down from the gods  
 to negotiate the terms for peace.  

PISTHETAIROS [to one of the slaves] 
 There’s no oil left in the jug.  

HERCULES  
 And bird meat  
 should be glistening with lots of oil.                                                                            

POSEIDON  
 We gods get no advantage from this war.  
 If you and yours were friendly to the gods,                                          
 you’d have water from the rain in all your ponds—  
 halcyon days would be here all the time.  
 We’ve come with total powers in such things.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 From the start we didn’t launch a war on you—  
 and we’re ready to talk peace, if that’s your wish,  
 provided you’re prepared to do what’s right.  
 And here’s what’s right: Zeus gives his sceptre back  
 to us—I mean the birds—once more. And then,  
 if we can settle this on these conditions,       
 I’ll invite the envoys to have lunch with me.                                       

HERCULES [salivating over the prepared bird]  
 That’s just fine with me! I vote we say . . .  

POSEIDON [interrupting]  
 What’s that you fool! Idiotic glutton!  
 You want give away your father’s power?                                                              

PISTHETAIROS  
 Is that what you think? Look, if birds here  
 rule everything down there, won’t you gods above  
 be even stronger? Now underneath the clouds  
 men can bend down and swear false oaths to you.  
 But once the birds and you become allies,                                                            
 if any man should swear by Raven and by Zeus  
 and then perjure himself, Raven would come by,                          
 swoop down upon the man before he sees him,  
 peck at his eye and pluck it out.  

POSEIDON  
 By Poseidon,  
 what you’re saying makes good sense!  

HERCULES  
 Sounds good to me.  

PISTHETAIROS [to the Triballian god]  
 What do you say?

TRIBALLIAN [speaking foreign gibberish]  
Nab aist roo.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 You hear what he said? He agrees with you.  
 Now listen up—here’s yet another benefit  
 you’ll get from us. If any man once vows  
 to one of the gods he’ll sacrifice a beast,  
 then tries to talk his way out of doing it  
 by splitting hairs and, acting on his greed,                                            
 holds back his vow, saying “Gods are patient,”                                                 
 we’ll make him pay for that as well.  

POSEIDON  
 How?
 Tell us how you’d do that.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Well, at some point,  
 when that man is counting up his wealth  
 or sitting in his bath, some kite will fly down,  
 while he’s not paying attention, grab his cash,  
 the value of two sheep, and carry that  
 up to the god.  

HERCULES  
 He gets my vote again—  
 I say we give the sceptre back to them.  

POSEIDON  
 All right—ask the Triballian.                                                                               

HERCULES [threateningly]  
 Hey, you—  
 Triballian—want me to smack you round?

TRIBALLIAN [afraid]  
 Oo smacka skeen dat steek?

HERCULES  
 He says it’s fine—  
 he agrees with me.  

POSEIDON  
 Well, if it’s what you want,                                                   
 then it’s all right with me.  

HERCULES [to Pisthetairos]  
 Hey, we’re ready to agree to terms  
 about the sceptre.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 By god, there’s one more thing—  
 I’ve just remembered. I’ll let Zeus keep Hera,  
 but he must give me that young girl Princess.  
 She’s to be my wife.  

POSEIDON  
Then you don’t want  
 a real negotiation. Come on, let’s go back home.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 That’s up to you. Hey, cook, watch that gravy.                                 
 Make sure you make it sweet!  

HERCULES  
 Hey, Poseidon,  
 my dear fellow, where you going? Come on,  
 are we going to war about a woman?

POSEIDON  
 What should we do?

HERCULES  
 Do? Settle this matter.  

POSEIDON  
 What? You fool! Don’t you see what he’s doing,  
 how all this time he’s been deceiving you?
 You’re ruining yourself, you know. If Zeus dies,  
 after giving all his sovereignty to birds,  
 you’ll have nothing. Right now you’re his heir—  
 you get whatever’s left when Zeus departs.                                           

PISTHETAIROS [to Hercules]  
 Oh dear, dear—how he’s trying to play with you.  
 Come on over here—let me tell you something.  

[Pisthetairos and Hercules talk apart from the others]  

 You uncles’s putting one over on you,  
 you poor fool—because, according to the law,  
 you don’t get the smallest piece of property  
 from your father’s goods. You’re illegitimate—                                                
 you’re a bastard.  

HERCULES  
 A bastard? What do you mean?

PISTHETAIROS  
 I mean just what I say. Now, your mother—  
 she was an alien woman. And Athena—  
 do you think a daughter could inherit                                  
 if she’s got legal brothers?

HERCULES [very puzzled]  
But once he dies,  
 couldn’t my dad leave me all his property  
 as a bastard’s share?

PISTHETAIROS  
 The law won’t let him.  
 The first one to claim your father’s property  
 will be Poseidon here, who’s raised your hopes.  
 He’ll claim he’s your father’s legal brother.  
 I’ll read you what Solon’s laws dictate—                                                                  

[Pisthetairos pulls a piece of paper out and reads]  

         “If there are lawful children, then a bastard  
 has no rights as a close blood relative.  
 If there are no lawful children, the goods                            
 go to the nearest next of kin.”  

HERCULES  
 What!  
 I don’t get anything from daddy’s stuff?

PISTHETAIROS  
 Not a thing, by god. So tell me this—  
 has your father introduced you to his kin group yet?[^note-186]  

HERCULES  
 No, not me. As a matter of fact,  
 I’ve been wondering about that for some time.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Well, don’t just stare up there, mouth wide open,  
 planning an assault. Join up with us instead.  
 I’ll make you a king and give you bird’s milk.                                   

HERCULES  
 I’ve always thought you’re right in what you say  
 about the girl. I’d hand her over to you.  

PISTHETAIROS [to Poseidon]  
 What do you say?

POSEIDON  
 I vote no.  

PISTHETAIROS  
 So now,  
 it’s up to the Triballian here. What you say?

TRIBALLIAN  
 De geerl geeve over greet souvrin bridies.  

HERCULES  
 There! He says to hand her over.  

POSEIDON  
 No by god!                                                                  
 he never said to give her up—no way.  
 He’s just babbling like a swallow.  

HERCULES  
 So he said hand her over to the swallows!  

POSEIDON  
 You two work it out—agree on peace terms.                                      
 Since you’re both for it, I’ll say nothing more.  

HERCULES  
 We ready now to give you all you ask.  
 So come along with us in person—  
 up to heaven—there you can get your Princess,  
 and all those other things as well.  

PISTHETAIROS [pointing to the cooking he’s been preparing]  
 So these birds were slaughtered in good time  
 before the wedding feast.  

HERCULES  
 If you want to,  
 I could stay here and roast the meat. You go.                                                    

POSEIDON  
 Roast the meat? You mean you’d wolf it down,  
 you glutton. Come on with us. Let’s go.                                                   

HERCULES [reluctantly leaving]  
 I’d have enjoyed eating that.  

PISTHETAIROS [calling to his slaves]  
 Hey, you—  
 one of you bring me out some wedding clothes!  

CHORUS  
 In lands of Litigation there’s a place—  
 it’s right beside the water clock—  
 where that villainous and thieving race  
 of tongue-and-belly men all flock.  
 They use their tongues to sow and reap,  
 to harvest grapes and figs en masse.  
 A crude barbarian tribe, a heap                                                                                        
 of Philipses and Gorgias.                                                                                          
 From these horse-loving sycophants,  
 who use their tongues to cram their gut,  
 through all of Attica’s expanse  
 in sacrifice the tongue’s first cut.[^note-187]  

[Enter Second Herald]  

SECOND HERALD  
 You here who’ve done fine things, more wonderful  
 than I can say, you thrice-blessed race with wings,  
 you birds, welcome now your king on his return,  
 as he comes back among these wealthy halls.  
 Here he approaches—you’ll never see a star  
 so bright in any gleaming home of gold.                                                                
 No—not even the far-reaching rays of sun  
 have ever shone as splendidly as he,  
 the man who brings with him his lovely wife,  
 too beautiful for words, and brandishing  
 the winged thunderbolt from Zeus. Sweet smells  
 are rising up, high into heaven’s vault,  
 a glorious spectacle, and wisps of smoke  
 from burning incense are blown far and wide.  
 Here he is in person. Let the sacred Muse  
 open her lips in a triumphal holy song.                                                    

[Enter Pisthetairos and his bride Princess]  

 CHORUS  
 Back off, break up, make room—                                                                                  
 And wing your way around the man  
 so blessed with blissful fortune.  
 Oh, oh—such beauty and such youth!  
 What a blessing for this city of the birds  
 is this fine marriage you have made.  

 A great good fortune now attends us,  
 the race of birds—such mighty bliss,  
 thanks to this man. So welcome back  
 with nuptial chants and wedding songs                               
 our man himself and his Princess.  

 Olympian Hera and great Zeus  
 who rules the gods on lofty thrones  
 the Fates once joined with wedding songs.  
 O Hymen, Hymenaeus[^note-188]  

 And rich young Eros in his golden wings  
 held tight the reins as charioteer  
 at Zeus’ wedding to the happy Hera.  

 O Hymen, Hymenaeus,  
 O Hymen, Hymenaeus.                                                                                            

PISTHETAIROS  
 Your chants fill me with great delight,  
 as do you songs. And I just love your words.  

CHORUS  
 Come now, celebrate in song  
 earth-shattering thunder, Zeus’ lightning fire—  
 which now belong to him—  
 that dreaded bolt white lighting, too.  
 Oh, that great golden blaze of lightning,  
 that immortal fiery spear of Zeus,  
 and groaning thunders bringing rain—                                                                   
 with you this man now rattles Earth.                                                          
 And everything that Zeus once had,  
 he’s got it all—and that includes  
 our Princess, who once sat by Zeus’ throne.  
 O Hymen, Hymenaeus!  

PISTHETAIROS  
 Now all you feathered tribes of friends,  
 come follow me on this my wedding flight.  
 Let’s wing our way up there to Zeus’ house  
 and to our wedding bed. Reach out your hand,  
 my blissful love, and take hold of my wing—                                                    
 then dance with me. I’ll lift and carry you.                                           

[Pisthetairos and Princess lead the procession off the stage]  

CHORUS  
 Alalalalai—  
 Raise triumphal cries of joy,  
 sing out the noble victor’s song—  
 the mightiest and highest of all gods!  

*[The procession exits singing and dancing, accompanying Pisthetairos and his bride up to Heaven]*  

    

 

[^note-101]: *Execestides*: An Athenian descended from Carian slaves and therefore not entitled to be a citizen. The point here is that he must have been extremely skilful to get to Athens, given where he started, and even he couldn’t navigate his way back to Athens in this terrain. 

[^note-102]: *Tereus*: the name of a mythological king of Thrace who married Procne and raped her sister Philomela. The sisters killed his son and fed Tereus the flesh for dinner. All three were changed into birds: Tereus into a hoopoe, Procne into a nightingale, and Philomela into a swallow. 

[^note-103]: *Tharreleides*: the reference here seems to be to a well-known member of the audience, perhaps celebrated for his small size and loud voice. 

[^note-104]: *birds*: the Greek expression is “to the Ravens,” meaning “go to hell.” 

[^note-105]: *Sacas*: a name for Acestor, a foreign-born tragic dramatist. 

[^note-106]: *tribe and clan*: the political units of Athenian civic life. 

[^note-107]: *basket, pot, and myrtle boughs*: these materials were necessary to conduct the sacrifices at the founding of a new city. 

[^note-108]: *twelve gods*: the major Olympian deities, headed by Zeus. 

[^note-109]: Most Athenians knew very little about peacocks. 

[^note-110]: *Cranaus*: reference to a mythological king who founded Athens or a word derived from *kranaos*, meaning rugged, a word often applied to Athens. 

[^note-111]: *son of Scellias*: the reference is to a man called Aristocrates, an important politician-soldier in Athens. 

[^note-112]: *difficult for me*: this is a utopian fantasy because the neighbour is suggesting that, as a punishment, his friend Euelpides would not have to help him if he gets in financial trouble, even though he’s invited him to an important family celebration. 

[^note-113]: *Red Sea*: a general term for any sea by the southern coasts of Asia. 

[^note-114]: *summons*: Athenian citizens could be legally summoned home for trial. Salamia was an official ship often used for such voyages. 

[^note-115]: *Melanthius’ fault*: the reference is to an Athenian tragic dramatist who had a very bad skin condition (making him look as if he had leprosy). 

[^note-116]: *Opuntius*: a widely disliked Athenian informer. A talent’s weight is just under 30 kilograms. 

[^note-117]: *Teleus*: Athenian politician with a reputation for being unpredictable. 

[^note-118]: *Melos*: the Athenians committed a horrible atrocity during the Peloponnesian War, starving the population of Melos and then executing all male citizens. 

[^note-119]: In some productions of *The Birds* the set design permits the audience to see inside Tereus’ quarters, so that the singer of the songs which follow remains visible to the audience. Alternatively, Tereus could move out onto a rocky balcony to deliver his song. It seems dramatically very weak to have him deliver these lyrics out of sight of the audience. 

[^note-120]: *Itys*: son of Tereus and Procne, killed by his mother, who served him up as dinner, in revenge for Tereus’ rape and mutilation of her sister. 

[^note-121]: *Hipponicus*: this passages refers to the Greek custom of naming children after their grandfathers. Philocles was a tragic dramatist. Callias, his son, was a notorious spendthrift who squandered his family inheritance on a debauched lifestyle. 

[^note-122]: *Cleonymus*: an Athenian politician well known for his eating habits and his size. He also reputedly once threw his shield away in battle and ran off. 

[^note-123]: *safer*: Pisthetairos refers to a race in which the runners wore helmets with plumes (crests), but Tereus misunderstands and talks about mountain crests where the birds live. Caria is in Asia Minor. 

[^note-124]: *shaver*: the Greek bird *kerulos* was a mythological species. The passage here plays on the similarity of the verb *keirein* meaning to cut hair. 

[^note-125]: *Athens*: to bring owls to Athens is an expression for something totally unnecessary (like bringing coals to Newcastle). 

[^note-126]: *Nikias*: Athenian general famous for his tactical skill. 

[^note-127]: *Orneai*: a siege in which some Athenians took part. There were no casualties. 

[^note-128]: *win*: a reference to the fact that The Birds is competing in a drama festival. 

[^note-129]: *Earth*: Kronos was the father of Zeus; the Titans were the sons of Kronos. Earth was the original mother goddess. 

[^note-130]: *Halimus*: a community on the coast near Athens. 

[^note-131]: *kite*: an old Greek custom of saluting the kite as the bird announcing the arrival of spring by rolling on the ground.This speech refers to the habit of carrying small coins in the mouth. Having eaten his money, he can’t buy the food he set out to purchase. 

[^note-132]: These lines are an attempt to deal with an totally obscure sexual pun in the Greek. 

[^note-133]: *Lysicrates gets*: a reference to a corrupt Athenian politician. 

[^note-134]: *Lampon*: a well known soothsayer in Athens. “By Goose” is a euphemistic way of swearing “By Zeus.” 

[^note-135]: *Kebriones* and *Porphyrion* were two Giants who fought against the Olympian gods. 

[^note-136]: These women all had sexual encounters with gods. Alkmene and Zeus produced Hercules; Semele and Zeus produced Dionysus; and Alope and Poseidon produced Hippothoon. 

[^note-137]: *Zan*: an archaic and contemptuous name for Zeus. 

[^note-138]: *crow*: in legend and folk lore the life span of the crow was enormous. 

[^note-139]: *Nikias*: Athenian general, famous for his hesitation about tactics. 

[^note-140]: *Erebus*: the primeval darkness. 

[^note-141]: *Prodicus*: a reference to a well known philosopher who offered a materialistic explanation for the origin of the gods. 

[^note-142]: These lines refer to the custom of giving one’s lover a bird as a present. 

[^note-143]: *Orestes*: the reference is to a well-known thief of other people’s clothing. 

[^note-144]: In other words, we’re all the oracles you need. Ammon, Delphi, and Dodona are shrines famous for prophecy. Apollo is the god of prophecy. 

[^note-145]: *Diitrephes*: prominent Athenian politician and general. A horse-cock is a mythological animal with the front of a horse and the rear of a cock. 

[^note-146]: poor people used esparto grass to make rope chords to hold up the mattress. Rich folks used linen. The pun here is obviously on Sparta-esparto. Euelpides won’t have anything to do with Sparta or anything that sounds like it. 

[^note-147]: *Theogenes and Aeschines*: two Athenian business men who constantly boasted they were richer than they were. 

[^note-148]: the *giants* were the monstrous children of Uranus; the gods are the Olympians, headed by Zeus. The point here is that Cloud cuckoo land is so great, it’s a place for divine boasting, not just the sort of thing rich Athenians might brag about. 

[^note-149]: *Cleisthenes*: a well-known homosexual in Athens, often satirized by Aristophanes. 

[^note-150]: The officer inspecting the sentries regularly rang a small bell to indicate that all was well. 

[^note-151]: *Hestia*: traditional goddess of the hearth. 

[^note-152]: *Cleocritus*: a very ugly Athenian who was often compared to an ostrich. 

[^note-153]: The *Chians* were staunch allies of Athens in the Peloponnesian War. 

[^note-154]: *Simonides*: well-known lyric poet of the previous generation. 

[^note-155]: These lines are a jumble of allusions to well known poems. The founder of Aetna is Heiron, ruler of Syracuse, whose name is the same as the word for “of holy things.” In Homer a nod of the head signifies divine assent. 

[^note-156]: *Lampon and Diopeithes* were well-known soothsayers in Athens. 

[^note-157]: *Meton* was a famous astronomer and engineer. 

[^note-158]: *Colonus*: a district of Athens. 

[^note-159]: *Thales*: very famous astronomer and thinker from distant past. Thales is often considered the founder of philosophy. 

[^note-160]: *Commissioner*: an official who was sent out to supervise and report on a new colony. 

[^note-161]: *Sardanapallos* was the last king of Assyria, famous in legend for his extravagant lifestyle and appearance. 

[^note-162]: *Teleas*, an Athenian politician, would have proposed sending the Commissioner out. 

[^note-163]: *Pharnakes* was an important Persian official. Dealing with him would be considered treasonous in some quarters. 

[^note-164]: A small town in the remote north east of Greece (by Mount Athos). 

[^note-165]: At the drama festival formal public announcements like this were part of the script. Diagoras was a notorious atheist who had fled Athens. The reward for killing old tyrants was part of a ritual pronouncement to protect democracy. 

[^note-166]: *Alexander*: another name for Paris of Troy. 

[^note-167]: The owls of Laureium are coins. The owl was stamped on Athenian coins, and Laureium was the site of the silver mines. 

[^note-168]: Greek temples commonly had triangular pediments known as “eagles.” 

[^note-169]: Pisthetairus compares Iris to a ship because her dressing is billowing like a sail. The two names he gives are the two main flag ships of the Athenian fleet. 

[^note-170]: *Porphyrion* was the name of one of the giants who went to war against Zeus. 

[^note-171]: The lines following refer to a number of political figures in Athens. 

[^note-172]: This reference is to a very popular betting game in which a quail was placed inside a circle and tapped on the head to see if it would back off or stand its ground. 

[^note-173]: Manes is probably another name for Manodoros, since there are only two slaves in the play. 

[^note-174]: I follow Sommerstein’s useful suggestion and add this line here to make sense of the lines which follow. 

[^note-175]: At the festival for tragic drama, the war orphans were paraded around in special armour given to them by the state. 

[^note-176]: *Cinesias* was a well-known and frequently satirized poet in Athens. He was extremely thin and evidently suffered very badly from diarrhea. 

[^note-177]: The tribes were the political divisions in Athenian life. The dithyrambic competitions were organized by tribes, each one wanting the services of the best poets. 

[^note-178]: *Leotrophides* was another Athenian famous for being extremely thin (like Cinesias). 

[^note-179]: The point here seems to be that the Sycophant’s cloak is so thin and worn that he’s singing for warm weather, when he won’t need it. 

[^note-180]: Cranes reputedly swallowed stones to serve as ballast on their flights. 

[^note-181]: These lines refer to the notion that meeting up with ghosts of heroes is all right during the day but harmful at night. There is also another reference here to the thief Orestes (mentioned earlier by the Chorus Leader) who beats people and steals their clothes. 

[^note-182]: *Thesmophoria*: an important religious festival in Greece, during which there was a period of fasting. 

[^note-183]: *Triballians*: the name of a barbarian tribe in Thrace, north of Greece. The Tiballian god who enters with Poseidon and Hercules a few lines later on cannot speak Greek, so his lines are incomprehensible gibberish. 

[^note-184]: *Prometheus* stole fire from heaven and gave it to human beings. 

[^note-185]: *Timon* was a legendary Athenian who hated his fellow citizens. 

[^note-186]: *Peisander*: an Athenian with a reputation for corruption and cowardice. Chaerephon was well known as an associate of Socrates. 

[^note-187]: *Laespodias*: Athenian politician who dressed oddly to conceal his misshapen legs. 

[^note-188]: A kin group (*phrateres*) was a group of citizens who shared a common ancestor. 

[^note-189]: These lines attack the Sophists who earned their living by teaching rhetoric. Gorgias was a famous sophist and Philip was his pupil and disciple. They are called horse-loving either to suggest extravagant ambitions or their non-Athenian tribal origins. In sacrificing an animal, the Athenians cut out the tongue first. The suggestion seems to be that that’s what the speaker would like to do with the Sophists. 

[^note-190]: A customary salute to the gods of marriage.
