**HISTORICAL NOTE**  

Aristophanes (c. 456 BC to c. 386 BC) was the foremost writer of comic drama in classical Athens. His surviving plays are the only complete examples we have of Old Comedy. Frogs was first produced in Athens in 405 BC. By this time Athens had been at war with Sparta for over twenty-five years.

*[The play opens on a street leading to Hades, with a door in the centre of the backstage area. Enter Dionysus, appearing as a middle-aged man with a noticeable paunch, wearing a yellow tunic and over that a lion skin. He’s carrying a huge club, one commonly associated with Hercules. On his feet he wears soft leather lace-up boots. Behind him comes his slave Xanthias riding on a donkey and carrying a huge amount of luggage. Xanthias notices the audience]*  

  

XANTHIAS  
Look, master, an audience! Shouldn’t I say something?  
Tell them one of those jokes they always fall for?  

DIONYSUS  
O, all right—say what you like. Only no jokes  
about how you’re dying to piss. I can’t stand those—  
they’re all so stale.  

XANTHIAS  
 What about my other jokes?  

DIONYSUS  
Go ahead—just nothing about your bladder,  
about how it’s going to burst.  

XANTHIAS  
 What? You mean I can’t tell  
that really funny one . . .  

DIONYSUS  
 I suppose so—  
but don’t say anything about the bit.  

XANTHIAS  
 What bit?  

DIONYSUS  
The bit about how you need to shift your load                                   
to take a piss.  

XANTHIAS  
 Not even this one—  
“Here I am transporting such a load  
if I get no relief I may explode.”                                                                                                              

DIONYSUS  
Please, please, don't say that one—  
not unless I’m sick and need to throw up.  

XANTHIAS  
Then what’s the point of my being here like this?  
Why do I get to carry all the heavy baggage  
if I can’t tell the usual porter jokes—you know,  
the ones Ameipsias and Phrynichus  
and Lycias, too, in all their comedies                                                  
provide the slave who carries all the bags.[^note-301]  

DIONYSUS  
Just don’t. Those jokes are all so feeble—  
when I have to watch a play and hear them  
by the time I leave I’ve aged at least a year.  

XANTHIAS [striking a heroic tragic pose]  
Alas, for my neck beneath this triply damned yoke.  
I suffer all this pressure and can’t tell my joke.                                                                       

DIONYSUS  
It’s an outrage, sheer insolence, that I,  
Dionysus, son of Winejar, have to walk like this,  
sweating along so he can ride at ease  
without a care and carrying no load.  

XANTHIAS  
 What!?                                                                                   
Aren’t I carrying the load?  

DIONYSUS  
 How can you be?  
You’re riding on your ass.  

XANTHIAS  
 I’m loaded down.  
All this stuff . . .  

DIONYSUS  
 What do you mean by that?  

XANTHIAS  
What I just said carries lots of weight.  

DIONYSUS  
Isn’t the donkey carrying our load?  

XANTHIAS  
No, no way. Not the load I’m holding.  

DIONYSUS  
 How come?  
How can you be carrying anything at all  
when someone else is carrying you?  

XANTHIAS  
 I’ve no idea.  
But my shoulder’s falling off.                                                                                                                      

DIONYSUS  
 All right, then.  
Since you claim the donkey’s useless to you,                                                              
why not take your turn and carry it?  

XANTHIAS  
 What a wretched life!  
I should have gone away to fight at sea—  
then I’d be free and I’d have told you straight  
what you could do with that ass of yours.[^note-302]  

DIONYSUS  
Get down, you useless idiot! We’re there—  
by the door I’m aiming for, my first stop.  

[Dionysus knocks very aggressively on the door and calls out in a very imperious tone]  

 Hey, in there! Doorman! I’m summoning you.  

[The door opens and Hercules steps out, wearing a lion’s skin and carrying a club. He’s amazed that someone is dressed up to resemble him]  

HERCULES  
Who’s banging on this door—smashing at it  
like some wild centaur. My god, what’s this?  

[Hercules inspects Dionysus’ outfit and starts to laugh uproariously]  

DIONYSUS  
Hey, my boy . . .  

XANTHIAS  
 What?  

DIONYSUS  
 Didn’t you see?  

XANTHIAS  
 See what? 50        

DIONYSUS  
How scared he was of me?  

XANTHIAS  
 Yes, by god, he was,  
scared you’re nuts.  

HERCULES [doubling up with laughter]  
 By holy Demeter,  
I can’t stop laughing. I’ll try biting my lip.  
No, no use. I can’t stop laughing at him.  

DIONYSUS  
Come here, my good man. I need something from you.  

HERCULES [still laughing out of control]  
I can’t help myself—he’s so ridiculous.  
Seeing that lion skin above that yellow dress.  
What’s going on? Do people with large clubs  
now walk around in leather booties?              
Where on earth do you think you’re going?                                                                      

DIONYSUS  
I’ve done naval service under Cleisthenes.[^note-303]  

HERCULES  
At that sea battle?  

DIONYSUS  
 Yes—and sunk enemy ships,  
twelve or thirteen of them.                                                                                                                       

HERCULES  
 Just the two of you?  

DIONYSUS  
Yes, by Apollo, we did.  

XANTHIAS  
 Then I woke up.  

DIONYSUS  
I was on board with Euripides' Andromeda,  
reading to myself aloud, when suddenly  
a huge urge seized my heart. You’ve no idea how strong.  

HERCULES  
An urge? How big was it?  

DIONYSUS  
 The size of Molon—tiny.[^note-304]  

HERCULES  
For a woman?  

DIONYSUS  
 No, no.  

HERCULES  
 A young lad, then?    

DIONYSUS  
Certainly not.  

HERCULES  
 Well, then, a man? 

DIONYSUS  
 Ugh!                                                                           

HERCULES  
Did you grab hold of your Cleisthenes?  

DIONYSUS  
Don’t mock me, brother.[^note-305]   I’m not doing so well,  
tormented by such hot desires.  

HERCULES  
 Tell me,  
my little brother, what’s it like?  

DIONYSUS  
 I can’t explain.                                                                                        
But I’ll try to show you by analogy.  
Have you ever had a craving for some stew?[^note-306]  

HERCULES  
For stew? In my life maybe ten thousand times.  

DIONYSUS  
Is that explanation clear enough to you?  
Or shall I try some other way?  

HERCULES  
 Not about stew!            
That I understand completely.    

DIONYSUS  
 Well then,                                                     
that’s how much I’m eaten up with my desire  
for Euripides.  

HERCULES  
 Even when he’s dead?[^note-307]  

DIONYSUS  
So no one’s going to talk me out of it—  
I have to find him.  

HERCULES  
 Right down in Hell?  

DIONYSUS  
 Or even lower,  
by god, if there’s such a place.                                                                                                                

HERCULES  
 What’s the point of that?  

DIONYSUS  
I need a clever poet. There’s none around.  
The ones we’ve got are all so lousy.  

HERCULES  
What? Isn’t Iophon still up there?[^note-308]  

DIONYSUS  
He’s the only good one left—if he’s any good. 
I’m not really sure if that’s the case.                                                            

HERCULES  
If you’ve got to take a playwright back,  
why not Sophocles? He’s better than Euripides.  

DIONYSUS  
Not ’til I get Iophon all by himself,  
without his father, Sophocles, so I can test  
the metal of his poetry. Besides, Euripides  
is such a rascal he may try to flee Hades                                                                                     
and come with me. But Sophocles was nice—  
easygoing while on earth and down here, too.  

HERCULES  
What about Agathon? Where’s he?  

DIONYSUS  
 He’s left us—    
a fine poet lamented by his friends.                                                                                           

HERCULES  
Where’s he gone?  

DIONYSUS  
 Off to feast with saints.[^note-309]  

HERCULES  
And Xenocles?[^note-310]  

DIONYSUS  
 O by god, may he drop dead!  

HERCULES  
Well then, Pythangelos?  

XANTHIAS  
 What about ME?  
In pain all this time—my shoulder's sore as hell.  

HERCULES  
Surely you've other artsy-fartsy types—  
thousands of tragic poets—all of them                                                                                          
way more wordy than Euripides?  

DIONYSUS  
 No, no—  
all chatterboxes, twittering swallows in a music hall,  
mere foliage—disgraces to the artist’s craft.      
Once they get a chance to stage their plays,                                                                      
to crap all over tragedy, they disappear.  
If you looked you’d never find one playwright,  
someone creative who could well declaim  
a worthy sentiment.  

HERCULES  
 That word “creative”—  
what’s it mean?  

DIONYSUS  
 Someone poetical enough  
to give utterance to something grand,  
something like  

[Dionysus strikes a tragic pose]  

“the sky, Zeus’ pied-a-terre,”  
“the foot of time,” or this—“a mind that will not swear                                               
on sacred offerings but a perjured tongue            
that’s false with no sense of its perfidy.”                                                                                

HERCULES  
You like that stuff?  

DIONYSUS  
 Like it? I’m crazy about it.  

HERCULES  
I swear it’s all bullshit—and you know it.  

DIONYSUS  
Now, now, don’t try to tell me what to think,  
not with tragedy. You’re no expert there.  

HERCULES  
I still say it sounds like total rubbish.  

DIONYSUS  
Why not teach me how to stuff my guts?  

XANTHIAS  
WHAT ABOUT ME??!!!!!  

DIONYSUS  
 That’s the reason I’ve come here  
and dressed like you—so you can fill me in,  
in case I need to know, about this place—           
who welcomed you down here, who'd you meet       
that time you went down after Cerberus.[^note-311]  
Tell me about the harbours, resting places,  
bakeries and brothels, water fountains,  
the cities, highways, all the detours,  
the local customs and the fine hotels,  
the ones with fewest bugs.  

XANTHIAS  
 Still no word of me.  

HERCULES  
O you valiant heart! Are you man enough  
to venture down below?  

DIONYSUS  
 Forget my courage.  
Show me the highway, the shortest one there is,                  
that takes me directly down to Hades.                                                                                    
Don’t prattle on about the temperature—  
and say it's way too hot or cold for me.  

HERCULES  
Let’s see . . . what should I mention first of all?                                                                   
Which one? Hmmm. You could try a stool and rope—  
you could just hang yourself.  

DIONYSUS  
 Stop it right there.  
 That way gives me a choking feeling.  

HERCULES  
There’s a straight short cut, well traveled, too—  
with pestle and mortar . . .  

DIONYSUS  
 You mean hemlock.[^note-312]  

HERCULES  
 That’s it!  

DIONYSUS  
Too cold—too much like winter. Right away   
the shins get frozen solid.  

HERCULES  
 All right, then.                                                 
You want me to tell you how to get there fast.  

DIONYSUS  
Yes, by god. I’m not one to take a hike.  

HERCULES  
How about a stroll to Kerameikos[^note-313] . . .  

DIONYSUS  
Okay, what then?  

HERCULES  
 Climb up the tower there—  
right to the very top . . .  

DIONYSUS  
 And then what?                                                                                                                     

HERCULES  
Take a look at the torch race starting up—  
when the spectators all yell out “They’re off!”  
then off you go as well.  

DIONYSUS  
 Off? Where to?  

HERCULES  
 Down.  

DIONYSUS  
No, I can’t take that road. I’d pulverize         
both rissole wrappers of my brain.  

HERCULES  
 What’s left?                                                                                                           

DIONYSUS  
The road you used.  

HERCULES  
 O, an enormous journey.  
At the very start you come to a vast lake—  
immense and bottomless.  

DIONYSUS  
 How do I get across?  

HERCULES  
In a tiny boat—miniscule—like this [indicating the size].  
An ancient sailor takes you for a fee—  
two obols.                                                                                                                                                                   

DIONYSUS  
 Two obols? It’s amazing  
what two obols can buy anywhere.[^note-314]  
How come it’s here in Hades, too?  

HERCULES  
 That was Theseus.[^note-315]  
He started it. Once past the lake you’ll find snakes.    
You’ll see thousands of them, horrific monsters.                                    

DIONYSUS  
Don’t keep trying to scare me. That won’t work.  
There’s no way you’ll get me to turn back.  

HERCULES  
Then a huge sewer, always full of liquid turds—  
and lying in it anyone who harmed a guest  
or screwed a lad and then took back the cash,  
or smacked his mother, punched his father’s jaw,  
or swore false oaths, or else had copied out                                                                             
a speech of Morsimus.[^note-316]  

DIONYSUS  
 By god, with them in the shit  
should lie whoever learned a war dance by Cinesias.[^note-317]    

HERCULES  
Next the breath of flutes will sound around you.                                                          
You’ll see the finest light, just like in Athens,  
and myrtle groves, with happy men and women  
gathered there to celebrate and clap their hands.  

DIONYSUS  
So who are they?  

HERCULES  
 Those are the initiates,  
the ones who celebrate the mysteries.[^note-318]  

XANTHIAS  
Then, by god, in these mysteries I play the ass.  
I’ll not stand for this a moment longer.                                                                                       

[Xanthias dismounts and starts to unload the baggage he has been carrying]  

HERCULES  
Those ones will tell you all you need to know.  
These initiates live closest to the road    
which takes you to the doors of Pluto’s place.[^note-319]                                                                
And so, my brother, I bid you fond farewell.  

DIONYSUS  
Good bye—god keep you healthy, too.  

[Hercules exits back through the door. Dionysus turns to Xanthias, who has just about finished putting down all the luggage he has been carrying]  

 You there—take up the baggage once again!  

XANTHIAS  
Before I’ve put it down?  

DIONYSUS  
 Yes, and hurry up.  

[Enter a solemn funeral cortege parrying a dead man towards Hades]  

XANTHIAS  
Come on, I’m begging you. Hire one of them—  
someone carrying the corpse. That’s why they’re here.  

DIONYSUS  
And if I don’t find anyone?  

XANTHIAS  
 I’ll do it.  

DIONYSUS  
Fair enough. All right, they’re bringing out a corpse                                                       
You there . . . you stiff . . . I’m talking to you . . . Hallo!    

[The corpse suddenly sits up straight]  

 You want to take a little luggage down to hell?                                                            

CORPSE  
How much?  

DIONYSUS  
 This stuff here.  

CORPSE  
 Will you pay two drachmas?  

DIONYSUS  
My god, no. Less than that.  

CORPSE  
 Then go away.  

DIONYSUS  
Hang on, my dear fellow. Can’t we haggle?  

CORPSE  
If you don’t pay two drachmas, forget it.  

DIONYSUS  
How about nine obols?  

CORPSE  
 No bloody way!  
I’d rather you shoved me back to life again.  

[Corpse lies down and the funeral procession moves away]  

DIONYSUS  
What a pompous boor!  

XANTHIAS  
 To hell with him—  
I’ll take the stuff myself.  

[Xanthias starts loading himself with the baggage once again]  

DIONYSUS  
 That’s my good man—  
a loyal and worthy slave. Let’s get that boat . . . .    

[Enter Charon rowing his small boat across the stage]  

CHARON  
Ahoy there! Coming alongside.                                                                                                             

XANTHIAS  
 What’s this?  

DIONYSUS  
 This?                                                           
By god, it’s the lake Hercules talked about.  
And I see the boat . . .  

XANTHIAS  
 You’re right. Thanks to Poseidon.  
This must be Charon.  

DIONYSUS  
 Ahoy there, Charon . . .  
Greetings, Charon . . . Charon, halloooo!  

CHARON  
Who’s seeks a rest from work and trouble?  
Who’s heading for Fields of Forgetfulness,  
Never-never land, the Cerberians,  
the Ravens[^note-320]   and Tartarus.  

DIONYSUS  
 That’s me.  

CHARON  
Then jump aboard.  

DIONYSUS  
 Where do you put in?       
The Ravens? Is that a stop?  

CHARON  
 Yes, by god—                                      
a special stop just for you. Get in.  

DIONYSUS [to Xanthias]  
All right, my lad, hop in.  

CHARON  
 I won’t take the slave—                                                                   
not unless he fought at sea to save his skin.  

XANTHIAS  
Not me, by god, no way. My eyes were bad.  

CHARON  
Then you must make a detour round the lake.  

XANTHIAS  
Where do I wait for you?  

CHARON  
 At Wuthering Rock[^note-321]  —  
right by the rest stop.  

DIONYSUS  
 You got that?  

XANTHIAS  
 I got that.  

[picking up the bags]  

 Why am I so unlucky? When we began  
I must've really pissed somebody off.               

CHARON [to Dionysus]  
Sit down there—at that oar.   

[Dionysus sits on one of the oars]  

 Anyone else?                                                      
Hurry up—all aboard! What are you doing?  

DIONYSUS  
What am I doing? I’m sitting on this oar.  
That’s what you ordered me to do.  

CHARON  
Come on, fatso—park your butt right here.  

DIONYSUS [moving off the oar]  
 There!                                                          

CHARON  
Can you pick up the oar? Stretch your arms.  

DIONYSUS  
 Like this?  

CHARON  
Don’t be such a fool. Set your foot there.  
Now pull the oar with all your force.  

DIONYSUS  
 How can I?  
I’ve had no practice. I’m no sailor.  
And besides, I’m not from Salamis.[^note-322]      
How'm I supposed to row a boat?                                                                                                

CHARON  
It’s not hard. You’ll hear lovely melodies  
once you make the effort.  

DIONYSUS  
 Songs? Whose songs?  

CHARON  
The amazing music of the swan frogs.  

DIONYSUS  
All right, then. Get the tempo going.  

CHARON  
Yo ho, heave ho. Yo ho heave ho.  

[As the small boat begins to move, the Chorus of Frogs is heard from off stage][^note-323]  

CHORUS OF FROGS          
Brekekekex koax koax  
Brekekekex koax koax.                                                                                                                                     
Children of the marsh and lake  
harmonious song now sweetly make,    
our own enchanting melodies                                                            
koax koax.  
The songs we sang for Nysa’s lord,  
for Dionysus, son of Zeus,  
in Limnai at the Feast of Jars[^note-324]  
as people in their drunken glee  
thronged into our sanctuary.  
Brekekekex koax koax.                                                                                                                                     

DIOYSUS [still rowing]  
I’m starting to get a pain in the ass  
from all your koax koax.     

CHORUS OF FROGS  
Brekekekex koax koax.                                                                                                                           

DIONYSUS  
Not that you give a damn about it.  

CHORUS OF FROGS  
Brekekekex koax koax.  

DIONYSUS  
Piss off—and take that koax koax with you.  
Nothing but koax koax.  

CHORUS OF FROGS  
Yes, and for us that’s fine  
you meddling fool—so asinine.  
Music-loving Muses love us too  
as does goat-footed Pan                                                                                                                                  
playing music on melodious pipes.     
Apollo as he strums his lyre                                                                
loves us and what we sing,  
for in the marshy waters here  
we grow the reeds that bridge his string.  
Brekekekex koax koax.  

DIONYSUS [still rowing]  
Well, I’m getting blisters and a sweaty bum.  
Next time I bend down it’s going to speak . . .  

[As Dionysus leans forward for the next stroke he lifts his rear end up in the air to fart at the Frog Chorus, but their next line drowns out the sound]  

CHORUS OF FROGS  
Brekekekex koax koax.  

DIONYSUS  
Stop it, you music-loving tribe!                                                                                                             

CHORUS OF FROGS  
No, no. We’ll sing on all the more—    
if we’ve ever hopped on shore                                                           
on sunny days through weeds and rushes  
rejoicing in our lovely songs  
as we dive and dive once more,  
or as from Zeus’ rain we flee  
to sing our varied harmonies  
at the bottom of the marsh,  
our bubble-splashing melodies.  

DIONYSUS  
Brekekekex koax koax—                                                                                                                             
from you I’m catching your disease!    

CHORUS OF FROGS  
If that’s the case, you’ll never please.                                                                                        
That’s hard on us.  

DIONYSUS  
 But worse for me—  
I may blow up here as I row.  

CHORUS OF FROGS  
Brekekekex koax koax  

DIONYSUS  
Go on. Keep croaking. I don’t care.  

CHORUS OF FROGS  
We’ll croak on ’til our throats wear out.  
We’ll croak all day.                                                                                                                                            

DIONYSUS  
Brekekekex koax koax  
You never beat me in this play!  

CHORUS OF FROGS  
And you’ve no chance to win your way,  
not matched with us.  

DIONYSUS  
 And you’ve no hope outdoing me.                                                               
No, no. If I must I’ll yell all day,  
koaxing you to get my way—  
Brekekekex koax koax  

[Dionysus listens for a response from the Chorus, but there is none]  

 You see. Sooner or later I was going to win—  
 and make you stop your harsh koaxing din.  

CHARON  
Stop it. Ship that oar alongside here.  
Get out . . . and pay your fare.  

DIONYSUS  
 Two obols? Here.                                                                                                     

[Dionysus pays Charon, who rows his way off stage. Dionysus starts looking around for Xanthias]  

 Xanthias! Hey, Xanthias!  

XANTHIAS [offstage]  
 Over here!  

DIONYSUS [still calling]  
 Come here!    

[Xanthias appears with the baggage but without the donkey]  

XANTHIAS  
Greetings, master.  

DIONYSUS  
 All right, what have we got?  

XANTHIAS  
Nothing but filthy muck—mud and darkness.                                                                

DIONYSUS  
Did you see the men who beat their fathers—  
or perjurers—the ones he mentioned?  

XANTHIAS  
You mean you don’t?  

DIONYSUS [looking at the audience] 
 By Poseidon, yes I do!  
Now I see them. So what do we do next?  

XANTHIAS  
We’d better get away from here.  
Hercules mentioned to us it's the place  
where wild beast prowl.  

DIONYSUS  
 To Hell with him!    
He was talking big to make me scared.                                                                                        
He saw I was a fighter, and he’s jealous.  
No one’s more full of it than Hercules.                                                                                   
But I’m keen now for some adventure,  
some exploit worthy of this expedition.  

XANTHIAS  
Of course you are. What’s that? I hear a noise.  

DIONYSUS  
What? Where is it?  

XANTHIAS  
 Behind us.  

DIONYSUS [pushing Xanthias]  
 Get behind me.  

XANTHIAS  
No, it’s up ahead.  

DIONYSUS [pushing Xanthias again]  
 You get in front.  

XANTHIAS  
 My god!  
Now I see it. Ooooh, a monstrous beast!  

DIONYSUS [cowering behind Xanthias]  
What’s it like?  

XANTHIAS  
 It's weird—all sorts of shapes. 
Now it’s an ox—no, no, a jackass—  
now it’s a woman—what a gorgeous babe!                                                                               

DIONYSUS  
 Where is she?  
I’ll go say hello.  

XANTHIAS  
 Hold on a minute!                                               
She’s not a woman any more. Now she’s a bitch!  

DIONYSUS [terrified]  
It’s Empusa!![^note-325]  

XANTHIAS  
 Her whole face is on fire!  

DIONYSUS  
Her legs—does she have one made of bronze?  

XANTHIAS  
 Yes!  
By Poseidon, yes! The other’s made of cow shit.  
And that’s no lie.  

DIONYSUS  
 Where can I run?  

XANTHIAS [imitating Dionysus]  
 Where can I run?  

DIONYSUS [appealing the audience]  
O holy man, save me—so we can drink together.[^note-326]  

XANTHIAS  
We’re screwed! Oh, lord Hercules! 

DIONYSUS  
 Don’t call me that!   
I’m begging you, my man—don’t say that name!  

XANTHIAS  
Then Dionysus . . .  

DIONYSUS  
 That’s worse than Hercules.                                                                                      

XANTHIAS [to the imaginary monster]  
Beat it! Shoo! Come on, master.  

DIONYSUS  
 What’s going on?                                                                     

XANTHIAS  
Cheer up—we’ve come through everything just fine.  
Now like Hegelochus we can recite  
“After the storm I see the seals are calm.”[^note-327]  
Empousa’s left.  

DIONYSUS  
 You swear?  

XANTHIAS  
 Cross my heart.  

DIONYSUS  
 Swear again.  

XANTHIAS  
Yes, by Zeus.  

DIONYSUS  
 Swear it one more time.  

XANTHIAS  
By Zeus, I swear.  

DIONYSUS  
 That was a close shave—  
looking at her almost made me puke.      

XANTHIAS  
You were so terrified you stained your pants.  

DIONYSUS [in a tragic tone]  
Woe, woe, why do such ills afflict me so?  
Which god shall I accuse of thus destroying me?        

XANTHIAS  
How ’bout Zeus’ airy pied-a-terre or the foot of time?  

[The sound of music being played on the pipes comes from inside the house]  

XANTHIAS  
Listen!  

DIONYSUS  
 What is it?  

XANTHIAS  
 You don’t hear that?  

DIONYSUS  
 What?  

XANTHIAS  
A tune played on the flute.  

DIONYSUS [continuing his tragic rant]  
 Ah yes, and now  
the scent of torches just came wafting o’er me,  
torches of mystery . . .  

XANTHIAS [interrupting]  
 Shhhh. Let’s squat down here—  
keep quiet and pay attention.  

[The Chorus of Initiates is heard offstage]  

CHORUS OF INITIATES  
Iacchus, O Iacchus,    
Iacchus, O Iacchus.  

XANTHUS  
Master, this is it—the initiates  
doing their chant, the ones he talked about—                                        
Diagoras’ hymn to Iacchus.[^note-328]                                                                                                                      

DIONYSUS  
It sounds like that to me. We’d best shut up,  
so we find out for sure.  

CHORUS OF INITIATES  
Iacchus, living here  
in your highly honoured shrines—  
Iacchus, O Iacchus  
in this meadow come to dance         
with partners in your mystery.  
Shake the garland round your head,  
the fruit-filled myrtle, come and tread        
our playful rite’s unbridled steps  
where the Graces join in, too—  
our pure and sacred dance and song,  
the chant of your initiate throng.  

XANTHIAS  
O holy noble daughter of Demeter,[^note-329]  
I just smelt roast pork—how sweet a smell that is.  

DIONYSUS  
If you keep quiet, you may just get a slice.   

[Enter the Chorus of Initiates carrying torches]  

LEADER OF THE CHORUS  
Awake the blazing torches in your hands!                                                                                 

CHORUS OF INITIATES  
O Iacchus, Iacchus—with us you stand  
light-bearing star in our nocturnal rite.                                                                                  
For now the meadow blazes light,  
old men’s knees will move again  
as they dance off their ancient pain,  
the lengthy cycle of their aged plight  
in this your ceremonial night..                                                                                                               
As your radiant torches blaze  
bring to this flowery marshy place,        
the forward march of all the young  
that constitute your choral throng,  
O sacred one.                                                                                                                                                    

CHORUS LEADER  
Let all those stand in silence here  
and keep their distance from our dance—  
all those who have no sure command  
of ritual words and purposes,  
who have not purified their hearts,  
the ones who’ve never seen or danced  
the noble Muses’ ritual songs,     
or played their part in Bacchic rites  
of bull-devouring Cratinus,[^note-330]  
or like words fit for foolish clowns                                                         
when such words are not suitable—  
or anyone who just can't turn away  
from fights and hateful party strife,  
who cannot be a genial citizen,  
easygoing with his countrymen,  
but lights and fans the flames of war,  
ambitious to advance himself,                                                                                                               
whoever guides our state through storms  
and is corrupted by some bribe,  
betrays our watch posts and our ships                                                    
or from Aegina smuggles goods,  
like that wretch Thorycion,  
our customs agent who shipped off  
illicit stuff to Epidaurus[^note-331] —  
oar pads and cloth for sails and pitch,  
or who persuades some other man  
to send supplies to hostile ships,         
or anyone opposing Hecate  
in dithyrambic choruses,  
or any politician setting out                                                                    
to pare back pay our poets get  
because they mock him in these rites,  
ancient rites of Dionysus.  

 I say to all such people, and I say again—  
and for a third time I state once more—  
stand back from our choral mysteries.                                                                                          
But those now here begin the songs,    
the dances lasting all night long,  
as fits our ceremonial throng.  

CHORUS OF INITIATES  
Now each one boldly marches on                                                           
into the meadow’s flowery lap,  
and each one stamps the ground—  
we joke, make fun, we mock,  
our bellies crammed with breakfast food.  

CHORUS LEADER  
Move on, now—but see you praise  
the saving goddess in a noble way,  
as you sing out our melodies.   
She says she acts to save our land                                                                                                       
from season unto season,  
against the wishes of Thorycion.                                                                                                    

 Come now, cry aloud another chant  
for goddess Demeter, our harvest queen,  
a celebration made in sacred song.  

CHORUS OF INITIATES  
O Demeter, queen of our sacred rites, stand with us here  
preserve us now, your chorus. Let me play in safety,  
let me dance all day, tell lots of really funny jokes,  
and offer many serious reflections, too.                                                                                      
Then, as befits your ceremonial rites, let me,  
with my ridicule and fun, take off first prize,  
let me wear the wreath, garland of victory.                                                                        
CHORUS LEADER  
Come now, with your singing summon here  
that lovely god, our partner in this dance.  
CHORUS  
Widely honoured Iacchus,  
creator of the sweetest joyful song,                                                                                                   
come here with us to Demeter,  
show us how you move along  
this lengthy way with so much ease.    
 Iacchus, lover of the dance,  
escort me forward as I prance.  
 In your playful penny-pinching mood  
you’ve torn my tiny dancing shoes,  
you’ve ripped my dress to shreds—  
Iacchus, you’ve found a way  
for all of us to dance and play  
what more, we never have to pay.  
 O Iacchus, lover of the dance  
escort me forward as I prance.     
 What's more, as I just glanced aside  
around me here, I saw a girl,                                                                                                                   
a lovely partner in the dance—                                                              
her scanty dress was ripped in two,  
I saw a nipple peeking through.  
 Iacchus, lover of the dance,  
escort me forward as I prance.  

DIONYSUS  
Hey, I’m always keen to enjoy myself.  
I’d like to dance with her.  
XANTHIAS  
 Me, too.  
CHORUS OF INITIATES  
Would you like to join us now in making fun                                                                       
of Archedemos, who at seven years old  
was toothless, no genuine Athenian teeth.[^note-332]  
And now he plays big shot in politics                                                     
among the dead above—the best there is  
at double dealing and corruption.  
And Cleisthenes, I hear, still picks his ass  
and rips his cheeks apart among the tombstones,  
blubbering over his dead lover Sabinos.  
And Callias, they say, son of the man  
who used to bugger his own horses,   
has fights at sea, naval entanglements,  
his arse hole covered by a lion skin.        `                                                                                       
DIONYSUS [approaching the Leader of the Chorus]  
Could you please inform the two of us                                                   
where Pluto lives when he’s at home down here?  
We’re strangers in these parts. We’ve just arrived.  
LEADER OF THE CHORUS  
No need to travel very far from here—  
so don’t ask me again. You should know  
you’re there—right at this very door.                                                                                              
DIONYSUS [to Xanthias]  
All right, lad, pick up the bags again.  
XANTHIAS [grumbling as he picks up the luggage]  
What’s this all mean—the same old storyline,   
with Corinth, son of Zeus . . . all this baggage.[^note-333]  
CHORUS OF INITIATES  
Keep up the dance  
along the round path sacred to our goddess,                                                                     
to the flower-bearing grove—let’s play  
with those who join this festival,  
the one our goddess so adores.  
I’ll join the women and the girls  
who dance to the goddess all night long,  
the ones who bear the sacred light.  
Let’s move on into flowery meadows,                                                                                         [450]    
the rose-filled fields, and worship there  
the way we always do, with song and dance,  
where blessed Fates assemble, too.                                                                                             
[The Chorus exits]  
DIONYSUS  
Let’s see—what style do I use at this point                                                                                
to knock upon the door? Which one to use?  
What’s the local style of knocking here?  
XANTHIAS  
Stop wasting time. Try chewing on the door—  
act like Hercules. You’ve got his height and might.  
DIONYSUS [knocking ]  
You in there! Doorkeeper!  
AEACUS [from inside]  
 Who is it?  
DIONYSUS  
 It's great Hercules!  
[Aeacus bursts through the door and grabs Dionysus very roughly]  
AEACUS  
O you abominable, you shameless reckless wretch—  
villain, villain, damned smiling villain—  
the man who made off with Cerberus my dog!  
You grabbed him by the throat and throttled him,                                                     
then took off on the run, while I stood guard.  
Now you’re caught—black-hearted Stygian rocks,                                                            
and blood-dripping peaks of Acheron  
will hold you down. Roaming hounds of Cocytus  
will gnaw your guts to bits—Echnida, too,  
and she’s a hundred heads. The Tartesian eel  
will chew your lungs, your kidneys bleed              
from entrails Tithrasian Gorgons rip apart.  
I’ll set out hot foot in their direction.  
[Aeacus lets go of Dionysus, who drops to the ground in terror. Exit Aeacusback into the house. Dionysus lifts his tunic and inspects his underpants]  
XANTHIAS  
What have you done?  
DIONYSUS  
 I’ve made an offering. Call the god.                                                                    
XANTHIAS  
You’re being ridiculous. Get up. Move it,                                                                                    
before some stranger spots you.  
DIONYSUS  
 I’m going to faint.  
Bring the sponge here—set it on my heart.  
[Xanthias rummages through the bags and finds a large sponge]  
XANTHIAS  
I’ve found the sponge! Here—you can do it.  
[Dionysus takes the sponge and begins to clean up his crotch with it]  
XANTHIAS  
Where are you putting that sponge? O golden gods,  
you keep your heart in there?  
DIONYSUS  
 It was scared—  
it ran off to my lower bowel.  
XANTHIAS  
 Of all gods and men         
no one’s more cowardly than you.  
DIONYSUS  
 Me?  
How can I be when I asked you for the sponge?  
Another man would not have asked, as I did.                                                                  
XANTHIAS  
What would he have done?  
DIONYSUS  
 Well, a coward  
would have lain there and stunk up the place.  
But I stood up—what’s more, I wiped myself.                                                                        
XANTHIAS  
By Poseidon, a valiant act.  
DIONYSUS  
 By Zeus. I think it was.  
Weren’t you scared shitless by his angry words,  
by all those threats?  
XANTHIAS  
 By Zeus, I never thought of them.  
DIONYSUS  
All right then, since you’re so brave, so valiant,         
you can be me. Take this club and lion skin.  
If you’re got the guts, I’ll trade places with you.  
I’ll carry all the baggage.  
XANTHIAS  
 All right.                                                        
I’ve got no choice. Quick, give me that.  
[Xanthias takes the club and puts on the lion skin]  
XANTHIAS [in the grand style]  
Now gaze upon the Xanthian Hercules—  
see if I turn coward and act like you.                                                                                              
DIONYSUS  
No, by god, you’ll well deserve a whipping.  
Come on, then, I’ll pick up the bags.  
[Dionysus starts to pick up a few of the smaller pieces. A Servant enters through the door]  
SERVANT  
Have you come back, my dearest Hercules?  
Come on in. Once the goddess heard you’d come         
she had us baking bread loaves right away,  
boiling up pea soup—two or three cauldrons full,  
roasting an entire ox, baking honey cakes                                             
and cookies. So do come in.  
XANTHIAS  
 That’s really nice,  
but I’m afraid . . .  
SERVANT  
 I won’t let you get away—  
by Apollo, no. She’s stewing bird meat,                                                                                        
toasting fresh desserts, mixing sweetest wines.  
Please come in.  
XANTHIAS  
 I appreciate it, but . . .  
SERVANT  
You can’t be serious. I won’t let you leave.  
There’s a lovely flute girl in there, just for you—         
two or three dancing girls, as well.  
XANTHIAS  
 What’s that?  
Did you say dancing girls?  
SERVANT  
 Young and in full bloom—  
all freshly plucked. So come on in. Right now                                        
the cook’s all ready to produce the fish.  
The table’s being brought in.  
XANTHIAS  
 You go on back.  
First, tell those dancing girls inside I’m coming.  
 [to Dionysus]  
 You, slave, follow me. And bring the baggage.                                                                   
DIONYSUS  
Hey, hold on a minute. All this pretence,  
you can’t be taking it so seriously.  
The fact I dressed you up as Hercules—         
that was just fun. Don’t play the fool with me.  
Pick up these bags again and bring them in.  
XANTHIAS  
What? You're not intending to take back from me                                
what you gave in person?  
DIONYSUS  
 You bet I am.  
Take off that lion skin.  
XANTHIAS  
 I want witnesses—  
I entrust my law suit to the gods.  
DIONYSUS  
 What gods?  
To think that you, a slave and mortal, too,                                                                               
could play Hercules, Alcmene’s son—  
so arrogant and stupid.  
XANTHIAS  
 All right, all right.  
Have it your way, then. Take the costume.         
Perhaps some day the gods'll make you need me.  
[Xanthias hands the club and lion skin to Dionysus]  
CHORUS  
There’s a man with brains,  
with keen intelligence—                                                                     
someone who’s sailed about a bit  
and always rolls himself around  
to the right side of the ship.  
He’s not one to stand transfixed  
like some image made in paint  
or frozen solid like a stone.  
To move away from where one stands         
to places much more comfortable—  
that indicates a clever man,                                                                                                                        
a born Theramenes.[^note-334]                                                                                                                           
DIONYSUS  
Now that would be extremely funny  
to see Xanthias, my slave, lying at ease  
enjoying bed linen from Milesia,  
as he smooches with some dancing girl.  
He asks me for a pot to piss in—  
but I, looking at him straight, grab him hard  
right by his cucumber.  
[Dionysus laughs at the thought, but then reconsiders]  
 But then he’d see me             
and, being a rascal, sock me on the jaw.  
He’d knock my front teeth out for sure.  
[Pandokeutria, a landlady, enters through the door, looks at Dionysus, and calls back through the doorway]  
PANDOKEUTRIA  
Plathane, Plathane, come out here.                                                                                           
That fellow’s back who came to our hotel  
and ate up all our bread, all sixteen loaves.                                                                             
[Enter Plathane, another landlady]  
PLATHANE  
My god, that’s the one.  
XANTHIAS  
 Oh, oh. Someone’s in trouble.  
PANDODEUTRIA  
And twenty boiled hams afterwards as well—  
at half an obol each.  
XANTHIAS  
 Now he’s in for it.  
PANDOKEUTRIA  
And lots of garlic, too.  
DIONYSUS  
 My good women, you jest.  
You don’t know what you’re saying.           
PANDOKEUTRIA  
 O yes, we do.         
You thought I wouldn’t know you any more  
because you’ve got those little booties on.  
What else was there? I haven’t said a word                                            
about the pickled fish.  
PLATHANE  
 You left out  
all the fresh cheese, by god, the scoundrel ate.  
He gobbled up the baskets, too.                                                                                                           
PANDOKEUTRIA  
 To top it all,  
when I tallied up his bill, he just looked at me  
and yelled, a massive roar right in my face.  
XANTHIAS  
That’s just like him. He does that everywhere.  
PANDOKEUTRIA  
Then he pulled out his sword—he looked insane.         
PLATHANE  
My god, you poor dear!  
PANDOKEUTRIA  
 We were both terrified.  
Somehow we ran up fast onto the shelf,  
and he took off, grabbing up the mats.                                                                                   
XANTHIAS  
Well, that’s exactly how he operates.  
PANDOKEUTRIA  
We’ve got to deal with him somehow. I know—  
go call my patron Cleon.[^note-335]  
PLATHANE  
 If you meet him,  
get Hyperbolos, as well. We’ll fix this fellow.                                                                          
PANDOKEUTRIA  
You wretched greedy swine—I’d be so happy  
to smash your molars with a rock, those teeth  
which gobbled down my stuff.  
DIONYSUS  
 That’s really nice—         
and I’d like to dump you in a deep ravine.  
PLATHANE  
I could take a sickle and slice that gullet  
which wolfed down all my tripe. Instead of that,                                                          
I’ll get Cleon to draw up a charge,  
so we can fish food out of him right here.  
[Exit Plathane and Pandokeutria]  
DIONYSUS  
Now, may I die the nastiest of deaths,  
my little Xanthias, if I’m not fond of you . . .  
XANTHIAS  
I know what you’re thinking. Just stop right there.                                                           
Don’t say a word. I’m Hercules again—  
but I won’t do it.  
DIONYSUS  
 Dear little Xanthias,      
don’t say such things.  
XANTHIAS  
 How could I be Hercules—  
remember I’m a slave and mortal, too.  
DIONYSUS  
I know you’re angry—you’ve a right to be.                                                                         
But even if you hit me, I won’t criticize.  
And if in future I take anything from you,  
may I be chopped down root and branch.  
Let me die in the worst way possible—  
me, my wife, and kids—and Archedemus, too—  
the man with clammy eyes.  
XANTHIAS  
On those conditions I accept your oath.   
[Xanthias and Dionysus exchange the lion skin and club once again]  
CHORUS:  
Since you’ve taken up the skin,                                                                                                               
the one you had before,  
your task is now to start again,                                                                                                 
to reinvigorate yourself—  
once more put on that dreadful stare,  
recall the god you imitate.  
If you get caught in foolish talk  
or squeak out squeals of fear,  
you’ll be compelled a second time  
to carry all the bags.                  
XANTHIAS  
Men, the advice you give me is not bad.  
I was thinking the same thing myself.  
What’s more, if all this turns out a success,                                                                        
he’ll try to take this back from me again.                                                                                   
I know that for a fact. But I’ll make myself  
a manly man—with a gaze like mustard.  
I need to do that—for just as I thought  
I hear the sound of scraping by the door.  
[Enter Aeacus with servants]  
AEACUS  
Tie up this dog thief. Get a move on, too—  
so we can punish him. Be quick about it.                  
DIONYSUS  
Oh, oh. Someone’s in trouble now.  
XANTHIAS  
 What the hell!  
You stay away from me!  
AEACUS  
 O ho, you’re fighting back!  
[calling inside the house]  
 Ditylas, Sceblias, Pandocus—outside!—                                                                           
come here and punch this fellow out.  
[Servants appear and begin to fight Xanthias]  
DIONYSUS  
It's shameful, a complete disgrace—                                                                                                
the way he hits them back—and more than that—  
he steals.  
AEACUS  
 That’s shocking.  
DIONYSUS  
 It’s even worse.  
It’s scandalous and dreadful.  
XANTHIAS  
 Now, by god,  
I’m prepared to die if I was ever here  
before today, or stole a thing from you         
that’s worth a hair. What’s more, I’ll make an offer,  
like a true gentleman—take this slave of mine  
and torture him. If you find out from him                                             
I’ve done wrong, then take me out and kill me.  
AEACUS  
How should I torture him?  
XANTHIAS  
 All the ways there are.  
Tie him to a ladder, hang him up,  
whip him with nails, twist him on the rack,                                                                              
strip off skin, fill his nose with vinegar,  
load bricks on him—do everything you can.  
Just don’t flog him with fresh onions or a leek.            
AEACUS  
That offer's fair. So if I beat the slave  
and cripple him, I’ll pay for damages.  
XANTHIAS  
Not to me. Just take him off for torture.                                                                               
AEACUS  
No. I’ll torture him right here, so he’ll confess  
before your very eyes.  
[To Dionysus]  
 Put down that load.  
And hurry up. Don’t give me any lies.  
DIONYSUS  
I here proclaim no one should torture me.  
I’m an immortal god. If you do so,  
you’ll have yourself to blame.  
AEACUS  
 What are you saying?                                                                                       
DIONYSUS  
I'm saying I'm Dionysus, an immortal,                  
a son of Zeus—this man here’s a slave.  
AEACUS  
You hear that?  
XANTHIAS  
 I hear what he claims to be—  
all the more good reason for flogging him.                                                                        
If he’s a god, he won’t feel a thing.  
DIONYSUS  
 You’re right.  
And since you also claim that you’re a god,  
why don’t you take as many blows as me?  
XANTHIAS  
Fair enough. Then whichever of the two  
you see bursting into tears or flinching  
as he’s whipped—you’ll know he’s not the god.  
AEACUS  
You’re a fine gentleman—that’s obvious.                                                                                 [640] 
You stand for justice. All right—the two of you,  
take off your clothes.  
[Xanthias and Dionysus remove their clothes and get down on all fours in preparation for the whipping. Aeacus produces a massive whip]  
XANTHIAS  
 How will you judge this?  
How will you keep it fair?  
AEACUS  
 That’s easy.                                                                                                           
I’ll alternate the blows.  
XANTHIAS  
 A fine suggestion.  
AEACUS [striking Xanthias]  
There!  
XANTHIAS  
 Watch closely if I flinch or not.  
AEACUS  
But I just hit you.  
XANTHIAS  
 By god, I didn’t feel a thing.  
AEACUS  
All right. Now I’ll lay into this one here.  
[Aeacus strikes Dionysus]  
DIONYSUS  
When are you going to start my whipping?  
AEACUS  
I just did.  
DIONYSUS  
 Why didn’t I sneeze?  
AEACUS  
 I haven't a clue.  
Back to this one again.  
XANTHIAS  
 Get on with it!                  
[Aeacus strikes Xanthias much harder than the first time]  
XANTHIAS [feeling the pain]  
 Ahhhh!!!         
AEACUS  
What’s that sound about? Did that blow hurt?  
XANTHIAS  
No, by god. I was just remembering                                                          
the feast for Hercules at Diomeia.                                                                                               
AEACUS  
The man’s a saint. All right, now this one’s turn.  
[Aeacus strikes Dionysus, again much harder than before]  
DIONYSUS  
Oooowww! Ahhh!!  
AEACUS  
 What was that cry?  
DIONYSUS  
 I see men on horseback.  
AEACUS  
Why are your eyes full of tears?  
DIONYSUS  
 I smell onions.  
AEACUS  
You didn’t feel a thing?  
DIONYSUS  
 No, nothing—  
nothing that bothered me.  
AEACUS  
 All right, then,  
back to this one here.  
[Aeacus hits Xanthias really hard]  
XANTHIAS  
 Aiiieeee!!  
AEACUS  
 What was that?  
XANTHIAS [pretending he has a thorn in his hand]  
A little prickle. Pull it out.  
AEACUS  
 What’s going on?                  
Now it’s this one’s turn.  
[Aeacus strikes Dionysus very hard]  
DIONYSUS  
 Aaaiiii!! O Apollo,  
who presides at Delphi and at Delos . . .  
XANTHIAS  
You hear that—the man’s in pain.  
DIONYSUS  
 No, I’m not.        
I was remembering some poetry,  
a verse from Hipponax.  
XANTHIAS  
 You’re getting nowhere.  
Hit him on the ribs.  
AEACUS  
 A good idea, by god.  
Stick out that pot of yours.  
[Aeacus hits Dionysus savagely on the ribs and stomach]  
DIONYSUS  
 Aaaiii! O Poseidon . . .  
XANTHIAS  
Someone’s feeling pain.  
DIONYSUS [continuing to recite poetry]  
 . . . you who command  
Aegean headlands and the green-grey sea . . .  
AEACUS  
Holy Demeter, I can’t sort this out.          
Which one's the god? You'd best come inside.  
My master Pluto will know who you are,                                                                                    
so will Persephone, his wife—they're gods.                                                                        
DIONYSUS  
Now you talking. I’d have liked it better  
if you’d thought of that before these whippings.  
[Dionysus and Xanthias and Aeacus go into the house leaving the Chorus on stage]  
CHORUS  
You Muses, enter now our sacred dance.  
Enjoy our songs and gaze upon  
the massive crowds of people here,  
thousands of clever thinkers in their seats,  
in love with honour more than Cleophon,        
on whose snarling lips a Thracian swallow sits,                                                                       
making an awful din—on that foreign leaf  
she squawks her nightingale’s lament,                                                                              
for he’ll soon be sentenced, sent to die  
although the jury’s votes create a tie.[^note-336]  
CHORUS LEADER  
It’s just and proper in this city  
our sacred chorus give advice and teach.  
So first it seems appropriate to us  
to free the citizens from inequalities—  
to ease their fears. So if a man slips up                  
thanks to the wrestling tricks of Phrynicus,[^note-337]  
I say we should allow the ones who fall                                                                                           
to state their case, reform their evil ways.                                                                     
Besides that’s no dishonour to our city.  
It would bring benefits. It’s scandalous  
that those who fought a battle once at sea  
should instantly become Plataeans,  
masters instead of slaves.[^note-338]   I don’t deny  
this worked out well—in fact, I praise it.  
It’s the only well-intentioned thing you did.         
But as well as this it stands to reason  
we should forget the single blow of fortune  
of those who fought so much at sea beside you,                                                      
just like their fathers, your ethnic kinsmen—  
that's what they keep requesting. But you here,  
whom nature made the wisest of all people,                                                                              
should drop your anger and make everyone  
who fights alongside us at sea a kinsman,  
a citizen. For if we are too proud,  
too puffed up with self-worth, especially now,         
when we’re encircled by the sea’s embrace,  
in future time we’ll look like total fools.  
 If I’ve a keen sense of the life and style                                            
of someone who will someday cry in woe,  
this tiny irritating ape Cleigenes,                                                                                                            
the most corrupt of all our laundry types,  
those noble men who cut the soap with ash,  
dilute the mix, and use Cimolian earth,  
won’t be with us long. He knows it, too—  
that’s why he’s not a man promoting peace.         
He knows that someday in a drunken fit  
he may well lose his staff of office,  
and, more than that, be stripped of all his clothes. [^note-339]  
This city, it often seems to me  
treats our best and worthiest citizens  
the way it does our old silver coins,                                                                                                    
our new gold ones, as well.[^note-340]   This money  
was never counterfeit—no, these coins  
appeared to be the finest coins of all,  
the only ones which bore the proper stamp.         
Everywhere among barbarians and Greeks  
they stood the test. But these we do not use.  
Instead we have our debased coins of bronze,                                                          
poorly struck some days ago or yesterday.  
That’s how we treat our finest citizens,  
the nobly born, our righteous men,  
our best and brightest, the ones well trained  
in music and the dance at the palaestra.[^note-341]  
Instead we use foreign bronze for everything—  
useless men from useless fathers, red heads,[^note-342]                                                                            
men who’ve come here very recently—  
the sort the city at its most negligent  
would never use in earlier days,                                                                                              
not even as a scapegoat.[^note-343]   But now,  
you silly fools, it’s time to change your ways.  
Use worthy people once again. You’ll see—  
if you’re successful, then you’ll merit praise.  
And if you fail, well, you’ll be a fine match  
for the tree you’re hanging from. At any rate,  
should you slip up, that’s what the wise will say.         
[Enter Xanthias with a servant from the house]  
SERVANT  
By Zeus who saves us, that master of yours  
is a very cultured gentleman.  
XANTHIAS  
 Of course, he is.  
The only things he knows are how to drink       
and dip his dink.  
SERVANT  
 But not to beat you on the spot  
when they proved that you’re the slave—and one  
who claimed you were the master.  
XANTHIAS  
 If he had,  
he’d have had regrets—and that’s a fact.  
SERVANT  
What you just did is worthy of a slave,  
something I love to do.  
XANTHIAS  
 Forgive my asking,  
but what is it you love to do?  
SERVANT  
 It's more than love—         
almost ecstasy—when I can curse my master  
out of ear shot.  
XANTHIAS  
 What about really bitching,  
whenever you’ve received a total thrashing                                            
and run outside?  
SERVANT  
 Yes, I do like that, too.  
XANTHIAS  
What about sticking your nose in everything?  
SERVANT  
By god, there’s nothing finer—that’s for sure.  
XANTHIAS  
By Zeus, divine protector of our race,                                                                                            
what about listening to our masters’ chat  
when they spread gossip . . .  
SERVANT  
 I’m even crazier for that!  
XANTHIAS  
. . . then passing on the gossip all around,   
to everyone outside the house?  
SERVANT  
 You mean me?  
Every time I do that, I piss myself.  
XANTHIAS  
By Phoebus Apollo, give me your hand,                                                                                
let me kiss you, and you kiss me.  
[Notices a noise from inside the house]  
 Tell me,  
by Zeus, patron of all flogged slaves like us,  
what’s going on inside the house, that noise,  
all that yelling and abuse?  
SERVANT  
 Oh that—  
that’s Euripides and Aeschylus.  
XANTHIAS  
 Ah ha!  
SERVANT  
Big, big trouble’s in the works down here  
among the dead—a massive civil war.                                                                                           
XANTHIAS  
What about?  
SERVANT  
 There’s a custom in these parts  
 that in the arts—the great and worthy ones—  
the best man in his special area                                                              
gets all his meals for free at City Hall  
in the chair of honour next to Pluto . . .  
XANTHIAS  
I get it.  
SERVANT  
. . . until someone else arrives  
who has more skill than he does. At that point,  
he has to yield his place.  
XANTHIAS  
 But why would this  
get Aeschylus upset?  
SERVANT  
 Well, he had his chair,  
the one for tragedy, as the finest                  
in that form of art.  
XANTHIAS  
 Who’s got it now?                                                                                                               
SERVANT  
When Euripides came down to Hades  
he started showing off his rhetoric                                                          
to thieves, bag snatchers, parricides,  
to all the ones who steal—and here in Hades  
that’s most of us. Well, they listened to him,  
heard his counter-arguments, his twists and turns,  
and went nuts for him. So they then proposed  
he was the wisest of all men. With that,  
Euripides got so worked up he claimed         
that chair where Aeschylus sits down.  
XANTHIAS  
Didn’t people throw stuff at him?  
SERVANT  
 My god, no.  
Quite the opposite. They all cried out                                                    
to have a trial set up which could find out  
which of the two men was the wiser poet.                                                                                 
XANTHIAS  
The crowd of scoundrels?  
SERVANT  
 Yes, that bunch—  
they made a din, by god—right up to heaven.  
XANTHIAS  
Didn’t Aeschylus get some support?  
SLAVE  
It's like this audience—too few good men.  
XANTHIAS  
So what’s Pluto planning to set up?         
SLAVE  
A contest— there's going to be a trial right here,  
a test of skill.  
XANTHIAS  
 What about Sophocles—  
how come he didn’t claim the poet’s chair?                                                                        
SLAVE  
My god, he wouldn’t. When he first arrived  
he kissed Aeschylus, shook him by the hand,  
and kept his distance from the chair of honour.                                                                  
And now, according to Cleidemides,  
he means to sit by as a substitute.  
If Aeschylus wins out, he’ll keep his place.  
If not, in this contest of poetic skill                  
he says he’ll fight on to the bitter end  
against Euripides.  
XANTHIAS  
 So this affair is on.  
SLAVE  
Yes, in a minute. In this very spot                                                          
some fairly weird things will be going on—  
they’re testing poetry with balance scales!  
XANTHIAS  
What?! They’ll weigh tragedy in milligrams?  
SERVANT  
And they’re bringing out some measuring sticks,  
rulers for words, framed rectangles . . .  
XANTHIAS  
Will they be constructing bricks?                                                                                                        
SERVANT  
. . . bevels, too,  
and wedges—all because Euripides                  
says he’ll test their tragedies, every word.  
XANTHIAS  
Well, my guess is that Aeschylus  
isn’t liking this at all.  
SLAVE  
 He just glared,                                                           
lowering his head as if he were a bull.  
XANTHIAS  
Who’s going to judge this trial?  
SLAVE  
 That’s difficult.  
Wise men are hard to find—in short supply.  
And Aeschylus didn’t really hit it off  
with the Athenians . . .  
XANTHIAS  
 Perhaps because  
he thought that most of them were criminals.  
SERVANT  
. . . and he considered other people         
worthless as judges of true poetry.                                                                                                     
So at last they turned toward your master,  
since he’s got some knowledge of that art.                                                                          
But let’s go in. There’s always trouble for us,  
every time our master’s in a rush.  
[Xanthias and the Servant go into the house]  
CHORUS [in a parody of the tragic style] 
Now the loud-roaring hero feels in full his fury—  
that valiant vehemence which surges up within,  
when he confronts his rival in poetic craft  
sharpening smooth-talking tusks, just like a boar.  
His frenzied passion's going to make those eyeballs roll.         
The battle’s here at hand—helmet-glancing war,  
horse-crested words, while splintered axles break apart,  
as the subtle chisel-worker tries to push and parry                  
steed-prancing phrases from the man who builds our minds.  
The bristling crest erect there on his shaggy neck,  
his natural hair, a fearful scowl upon his brow,  
and bellowing, he’ll launch his language fixed with bolts,  
like planking for a ship, he’ll rip the words apart,  
blasting with his giant’s lungs. The other man,  
the one who works his mouth, who tortures every word,         
unrolling his smooth tongue and shaking envy’s rein,  
will dissect and parse those words, and, splitting hairs,  
refute all that large labour of the former’s lungs.                                                   
[Enter Aeschylus, Euripides, Dionysus, and Pluto, with attendants]  
EURIPIDES  
I’ll not give up the chair—no more advice.                                                                               
I say I’m better in poetic skill.  
DIONYSUS  
Why are you silent, Aeschylus? You hear  
the claim he’s made.  
EURIPIDES  
 His high-and-mighty pose—  
he does that at the start of every play,  
some hocus-pocus for his tragedies.  
DIONYSUS  
My dear fellow, that’s too much big talk.         
EURIPIDES  
I know the man—and for a long time now  
I’ve studied him. He makes crude characters  
with stubborn tongues. As for his own mouth,                                                                
it’s unrestrained and uncontrolled, unlocked,  
no proper discourse, bombastiloquent.  
AESCHYLUS  
Is that so, you garden-goddess child?                                                                                              
You say that of me, you gossip-monger,  
a beggar’s poet who picks and stitches rags?  
You’ll regret those words.  
DIONYSUS  
 Hey, Aeschylus,  
hold on. Don’t fire up your heart so angrily,         
with such ill will.  
AESCHYLUS  
 No, no, I won’t hold back,  
’til I’ve exposed the man and clearly proved  
this cripples’ poet is a boastful fool . . .                                                                                   
DIONYSUS [to the attendants]  
Hey, boys, bring out a sheep—a black one, too.  
It looks as if a storm’s about to break.[^note-344]  
AESCHYLUS:  
. . . collecting all those monodies from Crete,  
importing impure marriage into art . . .[^note-345]                                                                                               
DIONYSUS  
Whoa, hold on there, much-honoured Aeschylus.  
And you, my poor Euripides, back off  
beyond this breaking storm—that would be wise,         
in case his anger cracks your skull in two,  
some heady phrase makes all your brain leak out  
your hero Telephos. And you there, Aeschylus,                                                              
don’t get so angry. Test him, but calmly—  
and then be tested, too. It’s just not right  
for poets to engage in such abuse,  
like two women selling bread. You bellow  
as if you were a tree on fire.  
EURIPIDES  
 I’m ready.                                                                      
I don’t mind biting or being bitten first,  
whatever he prefers, about my diction,                  
or the songs and sinews of my tragic plays—  
and by god, about Peleus, too,  
my Meleager or my Aeolos,                                                                                                                
or, even more about my Telephos.[^note-346]  
DIONYSUS  
What do you want to do? Tell us, Aeschylus.  
AESCHYLUS  
I have no wish to enter battle here.  
The war we fight is not on equal terms.  
DIONYSUS  
Why’s that?  
AESCHYLUS  
 My poetry did not die with me,  
but his did once he died. So it’s down here—  
he’ll have it with him when he wants to speak.         
But nonetheless since it’s what you want,  
we must go through with this.                                                                                                                
DIONYSUS [to the assembled group]  
 Come now,  
someone bring an offering here, and fire as well,                                                       
so I can pray before this contest starts,  
our battle of the brains, and judge the fight  
with maximum aesthetic expertise.  
[addressing the Chorus]  
 Now for the Muses you should sing a song.  
CHORUS  
O you nine sacred Muses  
mighty Zeus' virgin daughters,  
gazing down on subtle minds,                  
you see intelligence at work  
in men who write our maxims.  
When such as these go out to fight,                                                                                      
with counterarguments and tricks,  
with fiercely studied wrestling moves,  
with crooked throws, come to us here,  
observe the power of these mouths,  
their awesome skill in making words,                                                                                                
sawing phrases up like sawdust.  
Now our great contest in this art 
stands ready, let the business start.  
DIONYSUS  
Before we have you two recite your lines,  
you ought to offer up your prayers.   
AESCHYLUS  
 O Demeter,                                                          
who nourishes my mind, make me worthy  
to be there in your mysteries.  
DIONYSUS [to Euripides]  
 It’s your turn—  
take some incense. Make an offering.  
EURIPIDES  
 All right—  
but I pray to different gods.  
DIONYSUS  
 Personal ones?  
Your very own? Freshly minted?  
EURIPIDES  
 That’s right.                                                                                    
DIONYSUS  
Then pray away to those private gods of yours.  
EURIPIDES  
O air, my food, O pivot of my tongue,  
O native wit, O nose that smells so fine,  
whatever words I seize upon, let me  
refute them—let the victory be mine.                                                                                      
CHORUS  
Now we’re filled with great desire  
to hear from poets with such skill,  
the pathway in this war of words  
they’ll walk along. Their tongues are wild,  
no lack of boldness in their mood,  
nor are their intellects asleep.  
It looks as though we’re going to see                                                                                               
one man say something quite urbane  
and finely trimmed. The other one  
will seize him and his arguments,                                                                                                
the roots and all, and then attack  
and scatter words around the place  
like wrestle-rolling on a mat.  
DIONYSUS [To Aeschylus and Euripides]  
You must speak at full speed. But see you talk  
this way—with elegance, no metaphors,  
and nothing someone else might say.  
EURIPIDES  
 All right.  
As for myself—the kind of poet I am—  
I’ll say that in my final words. For first,  
I’ll demonstrate this fellow’s fraudulent,  
a cheat. I’ll show just how he took them in,                                                                       
and fooled those idiots reared on Phrynichos.[^note-347]                                                                     
First, he’d wrap a person up and sit him down  
with his face hidden away—some character  
like Niobe or his Achilles—  
mere window dressing for the tragedy.  
They didn’t speak or even mutter.  
DIONYSUS  
 That’s right. They didn’t.  
EURIPIDES  
And then his Chorus thumped their lyrics out—  
strings of them, four in a row without a break,  
the character just sat on stage in silence.  
DIONYSUS  
Well, I liked that they kept quiet. It pleased me.                                                          
It wasn’t any worse than those today  
who babble on and on.  
EURIPIDES  
 You were a fool—  
no doubt of that.  
DIONYSUS  
 I think so, too. But why so?  
Why did our friend here do that?  
EURIPIDES  
 It was a trick  
designed to keep spectators in their seats,  
waiting for when Niobe might start to speak.  
So the play continued on and on and on . . .                                                                          
DIONYSUS  
What a rascal! How he had me fooled!  
[to Aeschylus] Why are you fretting there and fidgeting?  
EURIPIDES  
Because I’ve caught him out. When he’d played this trick                      
and half the play was done, someone would speak up,  
a dozen ox-like words—with eyebrows, crests,  
some fear-faced things full of the bogey man,  
which no one in the audience understood.  
AESCHYLUS  
How miserable I feel . . .  
DIONYSUS  
 Stay quiet please.  
EURIPIDES  
Nothing he said was ever clear.  
DIONYSUS [to Aeschylus]  
 Don’t grind your teeth.  
EURIPIDES  
He talked on about Scamanders, trenches,  
shields with bronze enamelled griffon-eagles,  
in horse-cliffed phrases hard to comprehend.                                                                        
DIONYSUS  
Yes, by god, one long night I got no sleep                                              
from worrying what kind of bird was called  
the tawny clear-voiced horse cock.  
AESCHYLUS  
 You idiot!  
It was a symbol painted on the ships.  
DIONYSUS  
I thought it was Eryxis, Philoxenos’ son.  
EURIPIDES  
Did you have to work a rooster in  
just for the tragedy?[^note-348]  
AESCHYLUS  
 You god-forsaken wretch,  
what sorts of plays did you create?  
EURIPIDES  
 None like you—  
no horse-cock monsters or goat-stags, by god,  
the sort they paint on Persian tapestries.  
When I first took this art of plays from you,                                                                     
crammed with bombast to the gills, fustian stuff,                                                               
at first I made it slim, reduced its weight,  
with vesicles, and walks, and laxatives.  
I gave a potion drawn from bookish chat,  
and took care nursing it with monodies.  
DIONYSUS  
And you mixed in Cephisophon, as well.[^note-349]  
EURIPIDES  
I wasn’t fool enough to put in there  
whatever stuff I chanced upon, or add  
just anything I found. The character  
who came out first would right away explain                                         
on my behalf the background of the play.  
DIONYSUS  
Which was better than your own, by god.  
EURIPIDES  
After those opening words I never set  
anything superfluous in the play. No.  
For me the woman spoke—so did the slave,  
the master, maiden, the old woman, too.                                                                                  
AESCHYLUS  
Well, shouldn’t you be killed for daring this?  
EURIPIDES  
By Apollo, no. I was doing my work  
the democratic way.  
DIONYSUS [to Euripides]  
 My dear chap,  
I’d forget that—from your point of view                                                
that’s not the best line you could take.[^note-350]  
EURIPIDES [indicating the audience]  
I taught these people here to speak their minds . . .  
AESCHYLUS  
I say so too—and before doing that  
I wish you’d split apart—right down the middle.  
EURIPIDES  
. . . introducing subtle rules for words,  
for verses nicely trimmed. I taught them to think,  
to see, to understand, to love new twists  
and double dealing, to suspect the worst,  
to be too smart in everything . . .  
AESCHYLUS  
 I agree.  
EURIPIDES  
. . . and I brought in domestic issues, too—                                            
useful matters of things we understand,  
things people here could challenge me about.                                                                       
They know their stuff—so they could test my art.  
I didn’t boast or lose my common sense.  
Nor did I scare them all with characters  
like Cycnus and Memnon, who walk around  
with bells attached.[^note-351]   Look at our disciples,  
his and mine—you know them all quite well.  
Meganeitos and rough Phormisios  
are his—great long-beard-lance-and-trumpet men,                                                 
flesh-rippers with the pine—whereas, for me  
there’s neat Theramenes and Cleitophon.[^note-352]  
DIONYSUS  
Theramenes? Now, he’s a clever man,  
expert in everything. When he meets trouble,  
when it hits him in the face, he gets away,  
no problem, by changing who he is—  
if being a Chian doesn’t work for him,                                                                                          
he claims that he's Achaean.[^note-353]  
EURIPIDES [rushing his concluding speech]  
I taught these people here  
to think about such things.                                                                                                                  
I brought logic into art.  
I made them questioners.  
Now they see everything  
and understand it all.  
Their minds are more profound—  
they organize their homes  
much better than before.  
So now they ask “Where’s this?”  
“How’s it going?” “Who took that?”  
DIONYSUS [imitating Euripides speaking style here]  
Yes, by god, that’s what they do.  
Now each Athenian man  
goes home and starts to yell—  
to scream at his own servants,  
“Where’s my pot? My sardine—  
who’s bitten off its head?  
My bowl from bygone years,  
is it, too, dead and gone?  
And where’s my garlic clove?  
I had it yesterday.  
Who’s munching on my olives?”                                                                                                   
Before this, they’d just sit  
and gape there stupidly,  
like little mummy’s boys                                                                                                                              
and silly sweet-toothed fools.  
CHORUS [to Aeschylus]  
You see this, radiant Achilles,[^note-354]  
Come now, what can you say to him?  
Don’t let your anger take control  
and carry you beyond the track.  
He’s charged you with some dreadful things.  
But now, you noble gentleman,                                                                                                     
respond to him, but not with wrath  
Haul in your sails—except the tips—                                                                                              
then bit by bit bring in your ship.  
Keep watching for an easy wind.  
You just may get a gentle breeze.  
DIONYSUS  
Now you who were first among the Greeks  
to raise the solemn towers of spoken words  
adorning them with tragic gibberish,  
be strong and spout forth eloquence.  
AESCHYLUS  
This trial enrages me—it pains my spleen                                              
to have to answer such a man. But still,  
to stop your claim that I’m incompetent  
you answer this for me: Why should anyone  
admire the man who is a poet?  
EURIPIDES  
 For cleverness  
and good advice—and since we help improve  
the men who live within our cities.  
AESCHYLUS  
So if that’s something you didn’t do,                                                                                               
instead transforming fine and decent men  
to make them scoundrels, what would you say  
you'd then deserve by way of punishment?                                                                        
DIONYSUS  
Death—but don’t ask him.  
AESCHYLUS  
 Consider first  
the nature of the men he got from me—  
were they not nobly born and six feet tall?  
There were no runaways, no layabouts,  
no scoundrels like today, no ne’er-do-wells.  
No. Those men breathed spears and javelins,  
white-crested helmets, coronets, and greaves,  
with passions wrapped in seven oxhide folds.  
EURIPIDES  
This is getting bad.  
DIONYSUS  
 His helmet-making  
wears me down.  
EURIPIDES  
 What exactly did you do                                             
to make these men so noble?  
DIONYSUS  
 Aeschylus,  
speak up. Forget your pride and stubbornness.                                                                    
AESCHYLUS  
I wrote a play brim full of war god Ares.  
DIONYSUS  
Which one was that?  
AESCHYLUS  
 My Seven Against Thebes.  
Every man who saw it fell in love with war.  
DIONYSUS  
But you did something bad there with the Thebans—  
you made them more courageous in the war.  
For that you should be spanked.  
AESCHYLUS [to the audience]  
 You too,  
you could have trained yourselves for war as well,  
but you weren’t so inclined. Then after that,                                                                    
by putting on my Persians I instructed them  
so they were always keen to beat their foes—  
thus honouring our finest act.[^note-355]  
DIONYSUS  
 I was pleased  
when you cried out in sorrowful lament,  
“O child of Darius, who is dead,” and then,  
the chorus clapped its hands and all yelled out  
“Booo hooo.”  
AESCHYLUS  
 Poets need to work on things like this.                                             
Look back—they’ve been useful from the start,  
the noble race of poets. There’s Orpheus—  
he taught us rituals and not to kill,                                                                                             
Musaeus showed us cures for sicknesses  
and oracles as well, and Hesiod  
taught farming, harvest times, and how to plough.  
As for divine Homer, where’s his renown,  
his special fame, if not in what he taught,  
those useful facts about courageous deeds,  
and battle ranks and how men arm themselves.  
DIONYSUS  
Well, that may be, but Homer didn’t teach  
a thing to Pantacles, that clumsy oaf.  
The other day while marching on parade,                                                                           
he clipped his helmet on, and then he tried  
to tie the crest on top.  
AESCHYLUS  
 And brave men, too—  
Homer gave us lots—with them the hero  
Lamachos. I took Homeric warriors,                                                                                               
and let my brain write many noble deeds  
about great lion-hearted fighting men  
like Patroclus and Teucer—in this way  
I urged our citizens to match themselves  
with them, when they heard the trumpet sound.  
But by god I never made a single whore                                                 
like Phaedra or that Sthenoboia.[^note-356]  
No one’s ever known me as a man  
who writes about the way a woman loves.  
EURIPIDES  
No, by god. Whatever you possess,  
there’s nothing there of Aphrodite.  
AESCHLYUS  
Let her stay away! But she took her seat  
when she sat down hard on you and yours.  
She really squashed you flat.  
DIONYSUS  
 She sure did, by god.  
What you wrote about the wives of other men  
you had to suffer with your own.  
EURIPIDES  
 You wretched man,                                                               
How has my Stheneboia harmed our state?  
AESCHYLUS  
Because you helped persuade the noble wives                                            
of well-born men to drink down hemlock,  
ashamed of those like your Bellerophon.  
EURIPIDES  
My Phaedra story—did I make that up?  
AESCHYLUS  
No—it was there. But it’s a poet’s task  
to conceal disgrace—not put it on parade  
front and centre and instruct men in it.  
Small children have a teacher helping them,  
for young men there’s the poets—we’ve got                                           
a solemn duty to say useful things.  
EURIPIDES  
When you spout on of Lycabettus  
and subjects like magnificent Parnassus,  
does this involve your teaching useful things?  
We need to use the language people use.  
AESCHYLUS  
You pestering demon, don’t you see  
that noble thoughts and fine ideas perforce  
produce a language of commensurate size?  
Besides, it’s fitting for the demi-gods  
to speak in loftier terms—just as they wear       
much finer robes than ours. But you besmirched  
what I displayed with such nobility.  
EURIPIDES  
What did I do?  
AESCHYLUS  
 First, you dressed your kings in rags,  
to make them pitiful to all who watched.  
EURIPIDES  
If I did that, what damage did it do?  
AESCHYLUS  
It’s your fault no rich man any more  
is keen to pay out money for a ship.  
Instead he wraps himself in rags and weeps  
and whines about how poor he is.  
DIONYSUS  
Yes, by Demeter, that’s true. But underneath                                         
he wears a tunic of pure wool. And then,  
if he deceives them with a speech like that,  
he pops up in the market by the fish.[^note-357]  
AESCHYLUS  
And then you taught them how to babble on  
with stupid gossip—so the wrestling schools                                                                            
stood empty and the buttocks of our young,  
who chattered all the time, were quite worn out.  
You then convinced the Paralos’ crew[^note-358]  
to argue with their officers. In my day  
they were ignorant of this—all they knew                                              
was how to yell for food and cry “Yo ho.”  
DIONYSUS  
By Apollo, that’s right—and how to fart  
straight in the faces of the rowers there, or shit  
on sailors down below, their mess mates.  
On shore they’d rob someone. Now they talk back—  
they never row—just sail out here and there.  
AESCHYLUS [rapidly summing up his opening argument]  
What crimes is he not guilty of?  
Did he not put up on display  
pimps and women giving birth  
in holy shrines and having sex       
with their own brothers, and then claim  
that living is no life? So now,  
because of him our city here  
is crammed with bureaucratic types  
and stupid democratic apes  
who always cheat our people.  
Nobody caries on the torch—  
no one's trained in that these days.  
DIONYSUS  
No, by god, they're not. That’s why  
while at the Panathenic games       
I laughed myself quite pissless—  
a slow, pallid, porky runner  
went on by—head drooping down—  
far behind the rest. In that race  
he wasn’t very good. Well then,  
the folks at Keremeios gate  
began to whack him in the gut,  
to hit his ribs and sides and butt.  
While their hands were slapping him,  
he let rip a tremendous fart                                                                    
which killed the torch. Then on he ran.  
CHORUS  
The event is huge, the strife intense—  
the mighty war goes on. It’s hard to choose.                                                                              
When one man presses hard, the other one  
wheels round and launches the attack once more.  
[addressing Aeschylus and Euripides]  
 You two, don’t you stay inactive where you sit.  
For wit knows many varied ways to strike.  
And so, no matter what you’re fighting for,  
speak out, set to, bring up your works—  
the old and new. Put your daring to the test—                                       
say something that’s intelligent and deft.  
Don't be afraid the people watching here  
are just too ignorant and will not see                                                                                             
the subtle points in what you two may say.  
Don’t worry on that score, for it’s not true.  
They’ve served in wars—and each man owns a book.  
He understands the witty parts. You see,  
it’s in their nature to possess strong minds,  
but now the whetstone’s really sharpened them.  
So have no fears—examine everything—                                               
at least for the spectators’ benefit  
since they’ve become so wise.  
EURIPIDES  
All right, I’ll turn to the prologues you composed,  
so I can start off with a test to check                                                                                               
the first part of a clever poet’s tragedy.  
In setting down just how events occurred  
this man was never clear  
DIONYSUS  
 Which one will you test?  
EURIPIDES  
Quite a few. [to Aeschylus] But first, will you recite for me  
an opening from your Oresteia.  
DIONYSUS  
Let everyone keep quiet. Achilles, speak.                                                                             
AESCHYLUS [quoting from the Choephoroi]  
“O Hermes underground, who oversees  
my father’s power, be my rescuer,  
my ally, answering the prayers I make.  
I’ve come back and returned unto this land.”  
DIONYSUS  
You see some flaws in this?  
EURIPIDES  
 More than a dozen.  
DIONYSUS  
But the whole thing's only four lines long!                                                                                
EURIPIDES  
And each of them has twenty errors.  
DIONYSUS  
I warn you, Aeschylus, keep quiet. If not,  
you’ll forfeit these four lines and owe some more.  
AESCHYLUS  
Am I to remain silent just for him?                                                                                             
DIONYSUS  
I think that's best.  
EURIPIDES  
 Right at the very start  
he’s made a huge mistake—as high as heaven.  
AESCHYLUS  
You do see you’re talking rubbish.  
EURIPIDES  
 If so,  
it doesn’t bother me.  
AESCHYLUS  
 You claim I’m wrong—  
well, where are my mistakes?  
EURIPIDES  
 Recite the start again.  
AESCHYLUS  
“O Hermes underground, who oversees  
my father’s power . . .”  
EURIPIDES  
 Orestes says this  
at the tomb of his dead father, does he not?  
AESCHYLUS  
I won’t deny it.                                                                                                                                                      
EURIPIDES  
 Since his father died  
a brutal death at the hands of his own wife                                            
and by a secret trick, how can he claim  
that Hermes watches over anything?  
AESCHYLUS  
That’s not my sense—when he speaks, he means  
Hermes, god of luck, who watches all the dead.  
And his words clearly show that this Hermes  
obtained that office from his father Zeus.  
EURIPIDES  
So you’ve made an even bigger blunder  
than I thought—if this subterranean job  
comes from his dad . . .  
DIONYSUS  
 If that’s the case,  
he’s a grave robber on his father’s side.                                                                                  
AESCHYLUS  
That’s cheap wine you’re drinking, Dionysus,                                                                        
it lacks bouquet.  
DIONYSUS  
 Recite another line for him.  
[to Euripides]  
 And you, take care about the damage you inflict.  
AESCHYLUS [quoting again]  
“. . . my father’s power, be my rescuer,  
my ally, answering the prayers I make.  
I’ve come back and returned unto this land.”  
EURIPIDES  
The skilful Aeschylus has just revealed  
the same thing twice.  
DIONYSUS  
 How so?  
EURIPIDES  
 Look at the verse.  
All right, I’ll tell you—“I’ve come back”  
is followed by the word “returned”—coming back                                 
and returning—they mean the same.  
DIONYSUS  
 Yes, by god—  
exactly like a man who says to someone,  
“Hey, lend me a baking dish or, if you like,  
a dish for baking.”  
AESCHYLUS  
 You blithering idiot,                                                                          
it’s not the same at all. That line of verse  
has beautifully chosen words.  
EURIPIDES  
 It does?  
Then show me what you mean.  
AESCHYLUS  
 To come unto a land  
refers to someone with a native home—  
he’s come back—there’s nothing else implied.  
But when a man arrives who’s been an exile,                                                                   
he comes back and returns.[^note-359]  
DIONYSUS  
 By Apollo, that’s good!  
What do you say to that, Euripides?  
EURIPIDES  
I say Orestes didn’t "return" home.  
He came in secret, without permission  
from those in charge.  
DIONYSUS  
 By Hermes, that’s good.  
But I don’t get what you mean.  
EURIPIDES  
 Come on then,                                                                                                        
try another line.  
DIONYSUS  
 Yes, let’s have some more.  
Get a move on, Aeschylus. And you,  
keep looking out for something bad.  
AESCHYLUS [reciting more lines]  
“On this heaped-up burial mound I pray                                                
my father hears and listens . . .”  
EURIPIDES  
 It’s there again—  
he’s saying the same thing twice—  
to hear, to listen—obviously the same.  
DIONYSUS  
Well, you fool, he is speaking to the dead.  
And we don’t reach them even with a triple prayer.  
AESCHYLUS  
All right, how do you compose your prologues?  
EURIPIDES  
I’ll tell you. And if I say the same thing twice  
or you see extra padding there, some verse  
that doesn’t suit the plot, then spit on me.  
DIONYSUS  
Come on, speak up. I need to clearly hear       
the language in your prologues working well.  
EURIPIDES [reciting from one of his plays]  
“Oedipus to start with was a lucky man . . .”  
AESCHYLUS  
By god, no he wasn’t—his nature  
gave him a dreadful fate. Before his birth  
Apollo said he’d murder his own father—  
he wasn’t even born! How could he be  
a lucky man right at the very start?  
EURIPIDES [continuing to recite]  
“Then he became most wretched of all men.”  
AESCHYLUS  
No, no, by god. He always was like that.  
And why? Because as soon as he was born,                                                                        
he was exposed out in the cold, in a pot,                                                                                    
so he wouldn’t grow into a murderer  
and kill his father. He dragged himself away  
to Polybus on mutilated feet.  
And after that he married an old woman,  
though he was young, and, as things turned out,  
she was his mother. So he poked out his eyes.  
DIONYSUS  
Then he’d have ended happy after all,  
if, like Erastinides, he’d been a general.[^note-360]  
EURIPIDES  
You’re being stupid. I make my prologues well.                                                            
AESCHYLUS  
Is that so? Well, by god, I won’t scratch  
each phrase word for word, but with help from the gods  
I’ll kill your prologues with a little oil jug.                                                                                  
EURIPIDES  
My prologues? With an oil jug?  
AESCHYLUS  
 Yes, just one.  
The way you write, well, everything fits in—  
a little fleece, a little oil jug,  
a little bag—they all mesh nicely in  
with your iambics. Let me demonstrate.[^note-361]  
EURIPIDES  
What this? You’ll demonstrate?  
AESCHYLUS  
 That’s what I’m saying.  
DIONYSU  
 All right, Euripides, you’ve got to speak.                                                                              
EURIPIDES [reciting some more of his own lines]  
“Aegyptos, so many people say,  
with fifty children in a rowing boat,  
landing in Argos . . .”  
AESCHYLUS  
. . . lost his little oil jug.  
EURIPIDES  
What’s this stuff about an oil jug?  
You’ll regret this.  
DIONYSUS  
 Recite another prologue                                                                                               
so I can see the point again.  
EURIPIDES [continuing to recite]  
“Dionysus clothed in fawn skins leaps  
among the torches on Parnassus,  
on that mount he waved his thysrus—  
there he danced and . . .”  
AESCHYLUS  
. . . lost his little oil jug.  
DIONYSUS  
 O dear,                                                
we’ve been stricken with an oil jug once again.  
EURIPIDES  
It’s no big deal. In this next prologue  
he can’t tie in his little oil jug.  
“Among all men there’s not one living  
who’s blessed in everything—if nobly born  
he lacks sufficient livelihood, or else,  
if basely born, . . .”  
AESCHYLUS  
. . . he’s lost his little oil jug.  
DIONYSUS  
Euripides . . .  
EURIPIDES  
 What?  
DIONYSUS  
 It seems to me  
you should haul in your sails. This little oil jug—                                                               
it’s going to introduce a mighty storm.                                                                                   
EURIPIDES  
By Demeter, I won’t even think of it.  
Here’s one will knock that oil jug from his hand.  
DIONYSUS  
All right, recite another one—take care—  
keep your distance from that little oil jug.  
EURIPIDES  
“Abandoning Sidon city, Cadmus,  
Agenor’s son . . .”  
AESCHYLUS  
. . . lost his little oil jug.  
DIONYSUS  
My dear fellow, buy the oil jug from him,  
so he can’t shatter all our prologues.  
EURIPIDES  
 What?  
I should purchase it from him?  
DIONYSUS  
 I think you should.  
EURIPIDES  
No way. I’ve got lots of prologues to recite—        
ones where he can’t stick in his little oil jug.  
“Pelops, son of Tantalus, arrived at Pisa,  
and riding his swift horses . . .”  
AESCHYLUS  
. . . lost his little oil jug.  
DIONYSUS  
You see—he stuck in that little oil jug  
once again. Look, my good man, pay his price—  
use all your means. You’ll get it for an obol.  
And it’s really nice—a good one.  
EURIPIDES  
 Not yet—  
I’ve still got plenty left: “Oeneus once                  
from his own land . . .”  
AESCHYLUS  
. . . lost his little oil jug.  
EURIPIDES  
Let me at least recite the whole line first—                                            
“Oeneus once from his own land received  
a bounteous harvest—then while offering                                                                                 
first fruits for sacrifice . . .”  
AESCHYLUS  
. . . lost his little oil jug.  
DIONYSUS  
In the middle of the service? Who stole it?  
EURIPIDES  
Back off, my dear man—let him speak to this:  
“Zeus, as truth reports . . .”  
DIONYSUS  
 You’ll be destroyed—  
For he’ll just say “lost his little oil jug.”  
These oil jugs pop up in your prologues  
the way warts grow on eyes. For god’s sake,  
change the subject. What about his lyrics?                                                                          
EURIPIDES  
All right. I’ll show how bad he is at them.  
His songs are awful—they all sound just the same.                                                          
CHORUS  
What’s going to happen now?  
I’ve got an idea how  
he’ll criticize and mar  
the one whose lyrics are  
our finest songs so far.  
How will his censure ring  
to a Dionysian king,  
for me a fearful thing?  
  
EURIPIDES  
His songs are truly quite astonishing.  
I’ll give quick proof, for I’ll condense them all  
into a single song.  
DIONYSUS  
 All right, you do that. 
I’ll gather up some pebbles and keep score.  
[Someone begins the accompaniment on a flute]  
EURIPIDES [beginning his parody of Aeschylus]  
Phthian Achilles, O, you hear the crash—  
the loud man-slaughtering BASH, why don’t you come,  
come here to help us? As the primordial race,  
we honour Hermes by the lake—BASH.  
Why come you not to our assistance?  
DIONYSUS  
That’s two bashes for you, Aeschylus.                                                                                       
EURIPIDES [continuing the parody]  
Most glorious of Achaean men, O Atreus,                                                                                 
who rules far and wide, learn of me—BISH BASH—  
why come you not to our assistance?  
DIONYSUS  
There’s a third bash for you, Aeschylus.  
EURIPIDES [continuing the parody]  
Be still! Attendants on the bee priestess  
are nigh to open up Artemis’ shrine—BASH.  
Why come you not to our assistance?  
I have authority to utter out in full,  
to speak those fatal orders ruling us  
and this our expedition—BISH BASH.                                                                                     
Why come you not to our assistance?  
DIONYSUS  
By ruling Zeus, what a pile of bashes!  
The toilet’s where I want to be right now—  
this bashing’s swollen both my kidneys.                                                                                      
EURIPIDES  
Don’t go, not before you listen to  
another group of songs, compressed medlies  
of this man’s lyric melodies.  
DIONYSUS  
 All right then, go on.  
But you can leave out all the bash and crash.  
EURIPIDES  
 [continuing his parody of Aeschylus]  
How the Achaeans’ twin-throned power, youth of Greece—  
 Tophlatto-thratto-phlilatto-thrat—                                       
sent by the Sphinx, presiding she dog of unlucky days—  
 Tophlatto-thratto-phlilatto-thrat—  
swooping bird with spear and with avenging hand—  
 Tophlatto-thratto-phlilatto-thrat—                                                                     
granting eager sky-diving dogs to light upon—  
 Tophlatto-thratto-phlilatto-thrat—  
the allied force assembled to assault great Ajax—  
 Tophlatto-thratto-phlilatto-thrat.  
DIONYSUS  
What’s this phlatto-thrat? Is it from Marathon?  
Where did you pick up your rope-twisting songs?                                                       
AESCHYLUS  
I brought them to a noble place from somewhere fine,  
lest I be seen to gather up my crop  
from that same sacred meadow of the Muse                                                                           
as Phrynichos. But this fellow over here  
gets his songs anywhere—from prostitutes,  
Meletus’ drinking songs, flute tunes from Caria,  
from lamentations or dance melodies,  
as in a moment I will demonstrate.  
Let someone bring a lyre here—and yet  
who needs a lyre for this man? Where is she,                                                                  
that girl who beats time with her castanets?  
Come hither, you Muse of this Euripides—  
for your style fits the songs we’re going to sing.  
[Enter a very old and ugly woman who accompanies Aeschylus’ parody by clicking her castanets and dancing very badly]  
DIONYSUS [reacting to the old woman’s appearance]  
This Muse is hardly the most gorgeous babe 
we've ever seen from Lesbos, that’s for sure.  
AESCHYLUS [parodying Euripides]  
You chattering kingfishers in the sea  
in the ever-flowing waves                                                                                                                           
who wet wing-tops with water drops  
like so much dripping dew,  
and spiders underneath the roof,                                                                                                  
your fingers wi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-inding  
threads for stretching on the loom,  
work of tuneful weaving rods,  
where dolphins, those flute-loving fish,  
leap at the blue-peaked prows,  
at oracles and stadiums.  
I joy in early budding vines,                                                                                                                     
the spiral cluster, killing pain.  
O my child, hurl your arms about me . . .  
You see this foot?  
DIONYSUS  
 I see it.  
AESCHYLUS  
 And the other one?     
DIONYSUS  
 I see that too.[^note-362]                                                            

AESCHYLUS [to Euripides]  
You write this sort of bilge and then you dare  
to criticize my songs—you, who wrote your tunes  
to twelve-stringed music of Cyrene?[^note-363]   Bah!  
So much for his songs. I still want to check  
his solo melodies, their lyric style.                                                                                                     

[parodying Euripides once more]  

 O Night, O darkly shining Night,  
what are you sending me,  
what dreams of woe,  
from Hades’ halls—  
what souls without a soul,                                                                                                                     
the children of black night,  
so horrible they raise my hair  
in black corpse-clothes—  
murder, murder—  
such huge fingernails.  

 Now, servants, light my lamp for me,  
haul river water in your pails  
and warm it up, so I  
may rinse away my dream,                                                                                                                       
O spirit of the sea.                                                                                                                                        

 That’s it—oh all you  
who share this house with me,  
gaze here upon these portents.  
My Glyce’s fled away—  
she stole my cock and ran.  
You nymphs born on the mountain peaks,  
and you, O Mania, aid me now.  

 There I was, poor wretched me,  
at work with all my daily tasks,  
my spindle full of thread,                                                                                                                      
my fingers wi-i-i-i-i-i-i-inding,  
as I wove skeins of yarn  
to carry off to market                                                                                                                                     
for sale in early morning.  

 But now my bird has flown,  
flown off into the atmosphere  
its wing-tips oh so nimble.  
It’s left me woes, woes,  
and in my eyes tears, tears—  
they trickle, trickle down,                                                                                                                     
O miserable me.  

 O you Cretans, Ida’s children,  
seize your bows and rescue me.  
Swiftly move your limbs,  
make full circle round this house.  
And child Diktynna, Artemis,  
so beautiful, by all means bring  
your baby bitches to my home.                                                                                                             
And you, oh Hecate, Zeus’ child,  
with blazing fire-brands in both your hands,                                                                    
light my way to Glyke’s place,  
so I can then reveal her theft  
and catch her in the act.  

DIONYSUS  
Stop the songs.  

AESCHYLUS  
 All right. I’ve said enough.  
Now I want to bring him to the balance scale,  
the very thing to test our poetry—  
to check how much our phrases weigh.  

DIONYSUS  
Come here, then, if I have to do this—  
treating poets just like cheese for sale.  

CHORUS:  
Clever men like these take pains,  
for here’s a marvel once again.  
Devices new and strange they bring.  
Who else would think up such a thing?  
I’d not believe it—even though  
I met someone who told me so.  

DIONYSUS  
Come on. Stand beside the balance scales.  

AESCHYLUS and EURIPIDES [together]  
 All right.  

DIONYSUS  
Now, each of you grab hold and don’t let go  
until I yell at you—I’ll say “Cuckoo!”                                                                                               

AESCHYLUS and EURIPIDES: [each one holding a scale pan]         
We’re holding on.  

DIONYSUS  
 Speak your line into the scale.  

EURIPIDES [reciting]  
“I wish that Argive ship had never flown . . .”                                                                   

AESCHYLUS [reciting]  
         “O river Spercheios, where cattle graze . . .”  

DIONYSUS  
Cuckoo!!! Let go . . .  

[Dionysus inspects the scale pans and sees that Aeschylus’ side has sunk more]  

 The pan on this man's side  
has gone much further down.  

EURIPIDES  
 And why is that?  

DIONYSUS  
Why? Because he put a river in it.  
He wet his words the way wool-sellers do—  
whereas you put in a word with wings.  

EURIPIDES  
All right, let him speak again and match me.  

DIONYSUS  
Grab hold again.  

AESCHYLUS and EURIPIDES  
 We’re ready.  

DIONYSUS  
 So speak down.                                                                                 

EURIPIDES [reciting]  
“Persuasion has no temple except speech.”  

AESCHYLUS [reciting] 
“The only god who loves no gifts is Death.”                                                                       

DIONYSUS  
Let go. Let go. This one’s going down again.  
He put death in—the heaviest of harms.  

EURIPIDES  
But I put in persuasion—and my line  
was beautifully expressed.  

DIONYSUS  
 Persuasion’s light—  
she’s got no brains at all. Say something else,  
a heavy line, immense and ponderous, 
to make you sink.  

EURIPIDES  
 A heavy line like that,  
where can I find such lines in all my verse?  

DIONYSUS  
I’ll tell you. “ Achilles threw the dice—                                                                                          
two snake’s eyes and a four.” You’d better speak—                                
it’s the last time the two of you get weighed. 

EURIPIDES [reciting]  
“His right hand grasped the heavy iron club . . .”  

AESCHYLUS [reciting]  
“Chariot piled on chariot, corpse on corpse . . .”  

DIONYSUS  
This time he got you once again.  

EURIPIDES  
 How so?  

DIONYSUS  
He put in two chariots and two stiffs.  
A hundred Egyptians couldn’t shift that load.[^note-364]  

AESCHYLUS  
No more contest with me word for word—  
put him in the scale pan with his wife and kids,  
throw on Cephisophon. Let him step in,  
sit down—he can bring all his books. For me—                                     
I’ll only speak two verses of my own.                                                                                             

DIONYSUS  
These men are friends of mine, so I won’t judge  
the two of them. I don’t want to be at war  
with either man. One of them, I think,  
is really clever. The other I enjoy.  

PLUTO  
Won’t you fail to get the thing you came for?  

DIONYSUS  
What if I chose the other man?  

PLUTO  
 Take one—  
whichever one you wish, so you don’t leave  
and make your trip in vain.  

DIONYSUS  
 May gods bless you.  
Look, how ’bout this—I came here for a poet.                                                                 

EURIPIDES  
What for?  

DIONYSUS  
 So I might save our city  
and let it keep its choruses. Therefore,  
whichever one of you will give our state                                                                                      
the best advice, well, that’s the man I’ll take.  
So first, a question for each one of you—  
What’s your view of Alcibiades?[^note-365]  
This issue plagues our city.  

EURIPIDES  
 The people there—  
what do they think of him?  

DIONYSUS  
 What do they think?  
The city yearns for him, but hates him, too,  
yet wants him back. But you two, tell me this—                                     
what’s your sense of him?  

.EURIPIDES  
 I hate a citizen  
who helps his native land by seeming slow,  
but then will quickly inflict injuries  
which profit him but give our city nothing.  

DIONYSUS  
By Poseidon, that’s well said. Now, Aeschylus,                                                                      
what’s your view on this?  

AESCHYLUS  
 The wisest thing 
is not to rear a lion cub inside the city,  
but if that's what the citizens have done,  
we’d must adjust ourselves to fit its ways.  

DIONYSUS  
By Zeus the saviour, this decision’s hard.                                                                              
One spoke with skill, the other was so clear.  
All right, each one of you speak up again.  
Tell me of our state—how can we save her?  

EURIPIDES  
Use Cinesias as Cleocritus’ wings—  
then winds would lift them over the flat sea.[^note-366]  

DIONYSUS  
A really funny sight. But what’s the point?  

EURIPIDES  
In a sea fight, they’d take some vinegar,                                                                                     
and dump the bottles in opponents’ eyes.  
But I know the answer—let me speak.  

DIONYSUS  
All right, say on.  

EURIPIDES  
 When those among us                                      
who have no faith act faithfully, and things  
bereft of trust are trusted . . .  

DIONYSUS  
 What’s that?  
I don’t get what you’re saying. Speak out  
more clearly—more matter with less art.  

EURIPIDES  
If we removed our trust from politicians  
on whom we now rely, and used the ones  
we don’t use now, we could be saved. It’s clear  
we’re not doing well with what we’re doing now,  
if we reversed our course, we might be saved.                                                                       

DIONYSUS  
Well put, O Palamedes,[^note-367]   you clever man.                                                                           
Did you come up with this idea yourself,  
or is it from Cephisophon?  

EURIPIDES  
 It’s mine alone.  
that bit about those jars of vinegar—  
Cephisophon’s idea.  

DIONYSUS [to Aeschylus]  
 Now you. What do you say?  

AESCHYLUS  
About our state—acquaint me first of all  
with those in her employ. Surely they’re good men?  

DIONYSUS  
Of course they’re not. She hates those worst of all.  

AESCHLYUS  
She loves the ne’er-do-wells?  

DIONYSUS  
 Not really—  
but she's got no choice. She has to use them.  

AESCHYLUS  
How can one save a city like this one,                                                                                     
which has no taste for woolen city coats  
or country cloaks of goat skin?  

DIONYSUS  
 By Zeus,  
to get upstairs, you’d best come up with something.                                                       

AESCHYLUS  
Up there I’d talk, but I don’t want to here.  

DIONYSUS  
Don’t be that way. Send something good from here.  

AESCHYLUS  
When they consider their foe’s land their own  
and think of their land as the enemy’s,  
and when they look upon their ships as riches  
and see their wealth as wretchedness . . .[^note-368]  

DIONYSUS  
Yes, but jury members wolf down all the cash.                                                               

PLUTO  
You should decide.  

DIONYSUS  
 I’ll make my choice between them.  
I’ll choose the one who’s pleasing to my soul.  

EURIPIDES  
Do not forget those gods by whom you swore  
to take me home. You have to choose your friends . . .                                               

DIONYSUS  
My tongue made that oath, but I choose Aeschylus.  

EURIPIDES  
What have you done, you foulest of all men?  

DIONYSUS  
Me? I’ve picked Aeschylus to win. Why not?  

EURIPIDES  
Do you dare to look me in the face  
after you’ve done the dirtiest of deeds?  

DIONYSUS  
What’s dirty if this audience approves?                                                                                   

EURIPIDES  
You’re heartless. Will you never think of me  
now that I’m dead?  

DIONYSUS  
 What if living isn’t really dying,  
or breathing dining, or sleep a pillow slip?[^note-369]  

PLUTO  
Come inside now, Dionysus.  

DIONYSUS  
 What for?  

PLUTO  
So I can entertain you here, before you go.  

DIONYSUS  
An excellent idea, by god. I won’t say no.                                                                                  

CHORUS  
Blest is the man with keen intelligence—  
we learn this truth in many ways  
Once he’s shown his own good sense  
he goes back home again.                                                                                                                    
He brings our citizens good things  
as well as family and friends,  
with his perceptive mind.                                                                                                                            
So to be truly civilized,  
don’t sit by Socrates and chat  
or cast the Muses’ work aside,  
forgetting the most vital skills  
of writing tragedies.  
Wasting time with pompous words,  
while idly scratching verbal bits—                                                          
that suits a man who’s lost his wits  

PLUTO  
So now, farewell, Aeschylus—go,                                                                                                        
save our city with your noble thoughts,  
and educate our fools—we have so many.  
Take this sword, hand it to Cleophon.  
Present this rope to tax collector  
Myrmex and his colleague Nicomachos—  
this hemlock give to Archenomos.  
Tell them to come here fast without delay.  
If they don’t come soon, then, by Apollo,        
I’ll brand and cripple them, then ship them down  
at full speed underground with Adeimantos,  
Leucolophos's son.[^note-370]  

AESCHYLUS  
That I'll do. As for my chair of honour,  
give it to Sophocles to keep safe for me  
in case I ever come back here. He’s the one  
whose talent I would put in second place.  
Bear in mind—the rogue right there, this clown,                                                                
this liar, will never occupy my chair,  
not even by mistake.  

PLUTO [to the Chorus]  
 Let your torches shine,                                                                                             
your sacred torches light the way for him,  
escort him on his way—and praise his fame  
with his own songs and dances.  

CHORUS  
First, all you spirits underneath the ground,  
let’s bid our poet here a fond farewell,  
as he goes upward to the light. To the city  
grant worthy thoughts of every excellence.                                                                              
Then we could put an end to our great pain,  
the harmful clash of arms Let Cleophon—  
and all those keen to fight—war on their enemy                                   
in their ancestral fields, on their own property.[^note-371]  

 
  

[^note-301]: (line 21) Phrynichus, Ameipsias, Lycias: comic poets, rivals of Aristophanes.

[^note-303]: (line 61) Cleisthenes: a well-known homosexual in Athens, a favourite target of Aristophanes. 

[^note-304]: (line 68) Molon: a man remarkable for his size—either very large or very small. The joke would seem to demand something very small. Given the sexual innuendo, it may be the case that Molon was a very big man with (reputedly) a very small penis. 

[^note-305]: (line 72) brother: Hercules and Dionysus are both sons of Zeus, hence brothers. 

[^note-306]: (line 76) stew: Hercules was famous for his enormous appetite.

[^note-310]: (line 102) Xenocles and Pythangelos: minor Athenian tragic playwrights. 

[^note-311]: (line 131) Cerberus: in one of Hercules’ most famous exploits, he went down into Hell and returned with the Cerberus, the watch dog of Hades.

[^note-313]: (line 153) Kerameikos: a district in Athens. 

[^note-314]: (line 167) two obols: the standard amount for welfare payments or daily pay for soldiers and sailors. 

[^note-315]: (line 168) Theseus: the legendary founder of Athens, who made his own journey to Hades and back, and hence (according to this comment) introduced Athenian customs into Hades. 

[^note-316]: (line 178) Morsimus: an inferior tragic playwright. 

[^note-317]: (line 179) Cinesias: an Athenian poet. 

[^note-318]: (line 185) the mysteries: secret cult religious rituals for special groups of initiates. 

[^note-319]: (line 190) Pluto: god of Hades. 

[^note-320]: (line 218) Ravens: a reference to a curse invoking the ravens to pick someone’s bones. Charon lists various regions of Hell like so many stop on a bus route.  

[^note-321]: (line 226) Wuthering Rock: a part of the landscape of hell (possibly invented here by Aristophanes). 

[^note-322]: (line 239) Salamis: an island close to Athens, famous for its sailors. 

[^note-323]: (line 245) Chorus of Frogs: it’s not clear whether this chorus remains off stage or not. 

[^note-324]: (line 254) feast of Jars: a reference to an annual Athenian festival (the Anthesteria) held early in the year in the precinct of Dionysus "in the marsh" (Limnai). The festival involved a lot of drinking. 

[^note-325]: (line 332) Empousa: a celebrated Athenian ghost-monster who could change her shape. 

[^note-326]: (line 336) so we can drink together: Dionysus here appeals to the audience, specifically to the Priest of Dionysus who traditionally sat in the front row. 

[^note-327]: (line 343) Hegelochos . . . seals are calm: Hegelochos was an actor in Euripides' plays who garbled a word and made the lines ridiculous (like changing "sea" to "seal"). 

[^note-328]: (line 361) Iacchos was a minor divine presence associated with Dionysian celebrations. Diagoras may refer to a notorious Athenianatheist. 

[^note-329]: (line 375) daughter of Demeter: a reference to Persephone, wife of Pluto, king of Hades. 

[^note-330]: (line 399) Cratinus:a well-known and successful comic poet before Aristophanes.

[^note-332]: (line 479) Archedemos . . . teeth: a complex joke about a prominent Athenian politician, alleging that he is not a genuine citizen (sometingthat was determined at seven years of age). 

[^note-333]: (line 498) Corinth, son of Zeus: an expression meaning (in effect) "always the same old stuff." People from Corinth were (by reputation) never tired of boasting about the divine origin of the founder of their city. 

[^note-334]: (line 600) Theramenes: An Athenian politician famous for his political survival skills. 

[^note-335]: (line 633) Cleon . . . Hyperbolos: Athenian politicians with a special interest in leading the common people. 

[^note-336]: (line 762) Cleophon . . . votes are equal: Cleophon was an Athenian politician in favour of the war. The gibe here suggests he's not a true Athenian. Aristophanes' prediction that Cleophon would soon be sentenced to death came true a year later. 

[^note-337]: (line 768) Phrynichus: Athenian politician who led the revolution in 411 BC. 

[^note-338]: (line 775) Plataeans . . . masters instead of slaves: after the naval battle of Arginusae, the Athenians freed the slaves who had fought and gave them rights of citizenship equivalent to the rights of the Plataeans, important allies of Athens. 

[^note-339]: (line 800) Cleigenes . . . clothes: Aristophanes here attacks the keeper of a public bath and laundry for cheating his customers, predictng that soon he will lose his political office. 

[^note-340]: (line 804) our new gold ones, as well: a famous comparison between the political leaders and the debased coinage (one of the effects of the war). 

[^note-341]: (line 815) palaestra: the traditional school in Athens, emphasizing physical fitness and the arts. 

[^note-342]: (line 817) red heads: a reference to foreigners or slaves, not true Athenians. 

[^note-343]: (line 821) scapegoat: once a year in Athens two condemned criminals were beaten out of the city and executed in a purification ritual to cleanse the city of its collective guilt. 

[^note-344]: (line 962) about to break: Dionysus pretends he needs to offer a sacrifice to placate the god of storms. 

[^note-345]: (line 850) monodies . . . marriage into art: an attack on Euripides’ innovations and on the alleged immorality in his plays. Monodies are long lyrical solos for main characters. 

[^note-346]: (line 981) Telephos: a beggar hero of one of Euripides’ plays. 

[^note-347]: (line 1041) Phrynichos: the most important writer of tragedy before Aeschylus. 

[^note-348]: (line 1076) rooster . . . just for the tragedy: Aeschylus refers to a rooster in Agamemnon. 

[^note-349]: (line 1086) Cephisophon: an Athenian who lived in Euripides’ house and was rumoured have assisted Euripides with his plays and had an affair with his wife. 

[^note-350]: (line 1101) line you could take: Euripides’ sympathies in his life appeared to be with the oligarchs, not with the democrats in Athens. 

[^note-351]: (line 1117) with bells attached: Cycnus and Memnon were characters in plays by Aeschylus. Warriors had bells attached to their shields or to their horses’ harnesses. 

[^note-352]: (line 1122) Cleitophon: an Athenian member of the group around Socrates. 

[^note-353]: (line 1128) Achaean: this joke is hard to render accurately. The Greek says (literally) “not a Chian [i.e., from Chios] but a Kian” or (more freely) “not a Chian with a ch but a Kian with a k,” indicating the man’s slippery character, able to change nationality by altering the spelling of the word. The change to “Achaean” may make the joke somewhat more compressed and workable, especially when the speech is spoken rather than read. 

[^note-354]: (line 1155) Achilles: calling Aeschylus "Achilles" is a reminder both of his traditionally noble character and of his mood. Like Achilles he sits there silent and enraged. 

[^note-355]: (line 1203) finest act: a reference to the defeat of the Persians at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC, for most Athenians the high point of their city’s history. 

[^note-356]: (line 1231) Phaedra and Sthenoboea: an attack on heroines in plays by Euripides. 

[^note-357]: (line 1273) by the fish: a reference to the fact that fish was an expensive food in Athens at the time. 

[^note-358]: (line 1277) Paralos’ crew: the Paralos was the flag ship of the Athenian navy. 

[^note-359]: (line 1391) and returns: Aeschylus’ hair-splitting point is that “come back” and “return” mean different things, because the latter is appropriate for those whose political status is uncertain.  

[^note-360]: (line 1429) Erastinides: Athenian general condemned to death after the battle of Arginusae. 

[^note-361]: (line 1438) demonstrate: in the section which follows Aeschylus repeatedly uses the phrase "lost his little oil jug" to bring out the triviality of Euripides' verse, especially its rhythms and its imagery. 

[^note-362]: (line 1570) that too: Aeschylus is calling attention to the rhythmic feet in Euripides’ verse. Dionysus, of course, misunderstands and starts inspecting Aeschylus’ feet. 

[^note-363]: (line 1573) Cyrene: a notorious prostitute. 

[^note-364]: (line 1666) raise that load: Egyptians had a reputation for great strength. 

[^note-365]: (line 1686) Alcibiades: a brilliant and charismatic, but erratic and controversial Athenian politician and general in the closing years of the Peloponnesian War. 

[^note-366]: (line 1705) flat sea: Cinesias was very tall and skinny, and Cleocritus was reported to look like an ostrich. 

[^note-367]: (line 1720) Palamedes: a hero in the Trojan war. 

[^note-368]: (line 1739) wretchedness: Aeschylus is here apparently defending the early Athenian policy of putting all their faith in the navy to prosecute the war, leaving the land open for enemy occupation. 

[^note-369]: (line 1753) pillow slip: Dionysus is here mocking Euripides with echoes of the latter’s own verses. 

[^note-370]: (line 1783) Adeimantos: a general in Athens, later accused of treachery. 

[^note-371]: (line 1801) properties: Cleophon was a leader of the pro-war party. The point here is that many of those advocating war were not putting their own property in danger, unlike many Athenian farmers and landowners whose lands were occupied by the enemy forces.
