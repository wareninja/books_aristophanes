It’s clear that in this play the male characters all wear the comic phallus, which is an integral part of the action throughout. Note, too, that in several places in Lysistrata there is some confusion and debate over which speeches are assigned to which people. These moments occur, for the most part, in short conversational exchanges. Hence, there may be some differences between the speakers in this text and those in other translations.

LYSISTRATA  
 If they’d called a Bacchic celebration  
 or some festival for Pan or Colias  
 or for Genetyllis, you’d not be able  
 to move around through all the kettle drums.  
 But as it is, there are no women here.  

[Calonice enters, coming to meet Lysistrata]  

 Ah, here’s my neighbour—at least she’s come.[^note-501]  
 Hello, Calonice.  

CALONICE  
 Hello, Lysistrata.  
 What’s bothering you, child? Don’t look so annoyed.  
 It doesn’t suit you. Your eyes get wrinkled.  

LYSISTRATA  
 My heart’s on fire, Calonice—I’m so angry                                   
 at married women, at us, because,                                                                                              
 although men say we’re devious characters . . .  

CALONICE [interrupting]  
 Because by god we are!  

LYSISTRATA [continuing]  
. . . when I call them all  
 to meet here to discuss some serious business,  
 they just stay in bed and don’t show up.  

CALONICE  
 Ah, my dear, they’ll come. It’s not so easy  
 for wives to get away. We’ve got to fuss  
 about our husbands, wake up the servants,  
 calm and wash the babies, then give them food. 

LYSISTRATA  
 But there are other things they need to do—  
 more important issues.  

CALONICE  
 My dear Lysistrata,  
 why have you asked the women to meet here?  
 What’s going on? Is it something big?  

LYSISTRATA  
 It’s huge.  

CALONICE  
 And hard as well?  

LYSISTRATA  
 Yes, by god, really hard.  

CALONICE  
 Then why aren’t we all here?  

LYSISTRATA  
 I don’t mean that!  
 If that were it, they’d all be charging here so fast.  
 No. It’s something I’ve been playing with—  
 wrestling with for many sleepless nights.  

CALONICE  
 If you’ve been working it like that, by now  
 it must have shrivelled up.  

LYSISTRATA  
 Yes, so shrivelled up                                         
 that the salvation of the whole of Greece                                                                                           
 is now in women’s hands.  

CALONICE  
 In women’s hands?  
 Then it won’t be long before we done for.  

LYSISTRATA  
 It’s up to us to run the state’s affairs—  
 the Spartans would no longer be around.  

CALONICE  
 If they weren’t there, by god, not any more,  
 that would be good news.  

LYSISTRATA  
 And then if all Boeotians  
 were totally destroyed!  

CALONICE  
 Not all of them—  
 you’d have to save the eels.[^note-502]  

LYSISTRATA  
 As for Athens,  
 I won’t say anything as bad as that.                                                                            
 You can imagine what I’d say. But now,  
 if only all the women would come here  
 from Sparta and Boeotia, join up with us,                                                                           
 if we worked together, we’d save Greece.  

CALONICE  
 But what sensible or splendid act  
 could women do? We sit around playing  
 with our cosmetics, wearing golden clothes,  
 posing in Cimmerian silks and slippers.  

LYSISTRATA  
 Those are the very things which I assume                                            
 will save us—short dresses, perfumes, slippers,                                              
 make up, and clothing men can see through.  

CALONICE  
 How’s that going to work?  

LYSISTRATA  
 No man living  
 will lift his spear against another man . . .                                                                           

CALONICE [interrupting]  
 By the two goddesses, I must take my dress 
 and dye it yellow.[^note-503]  

LYSISTRATA [continuing]  
. . . or pick up a shield . . . 

CALONICE [interrupting again]  
 I’ll have to wear my very best silk dress.  

LYSISTRATA [continuing]  
. . . or pull out his sword.  

CALONICE  
 I need to get some shoes.  

LYSISTRATA  
 O these women, they should be here by now!  

CALONICE  
 Yes, by god! They should have sprouted wings 
 and come here hours ago.  

LYSISTRATA  
 They’re true Athenians,                                                
 you’ll see—everything they should be doing  
 they postpone till later. But no one’s come  
 from Salamis or those towns on the coast.  

CALONICE [with an obscene gesture]  
 I know those women—they were up early  
 on their boats riding the mizzen mast.                                                                                   

LYSISTRATA  
 I’d have bet  
 those women from Acharnia would come  
 and get here first. But they’ve not shown up.  

CALONICE  
 Well, Theogenes’ wife will be here.  
 I saw her hoisting sail to come.[^note-504]   Hey, look!  
 Here’s a group of women coming for you.                                                          
 And there’s another one, as well. Hello!  
 Hello there! Where they from?  

[Various women start arriving from all directions]  

LYSISTRATA  
 Those? From Anagyrus.  

CALONICE  
 My god, it seem we’re kicking up a stink.[^note-505]  

[Enter Myrrhine]  

MYRRHINE 
 Hey, Lysistrata, did we get here late?  
 What’s the matter? Why are you so quiet?  

LYSISTRATA  
 I’m not pleased with you, Myrrhine. You’re late.                                                       
 And this is serious business.  

MYRRHINE  
 It was dark.  
 I had trouble tracking down my waist band.  
 If it’s such a big deal, tell these women.  

LYSISTRATA  
 No, let’s wait a while until the women                                          
 from Boeotia and from Sparta get here.  

MYRRHINE  
 All right. That sounds like the best idea.  
 Hey, here comes Lampito.  

[Lampito enters with some other Spartan women and with Ismenia, 
a woman from Thebes]  

LYSISTRATA  
 Hello Lampito,  
 my dear friend from Sparta. How beautiful  
 you look, so sweet, such a fine complexion.                                                                     
 And your body looks so fit, strong enough  
 to choke a bull.  

LAMPITO[^note-506]  
 Yes, by the two gods,  
 I could pull that off.[^note-507]   I do exercise  
 and work out to keep my bum well toned.  

CALONICE [fondling Lampito’s bosom]  
 What an amazing pair of breasts you’ve got!                                                    

LAMPITO  
 O, you stroke me like I’m a sacrifice.    

LYSISTRATA [looking at Ismenia]  
 And this young woman—where’s she from?                                                                    

LAMPITO  
 By the twin gods, she’s an ambassador—  
 she’s from Boeotia.  

MYRRHINE [looking down Ismenia’s elegant clothes]  
 Of course, from Boeotia.  
 She’s got a beautiful lowland region.  

CALONICE [peering down Ismenia’s dress to see her pubic hair]  
 Yes. By god, she keeps that territory  
 elegantly groomed.  

LYSISTRATA  
 Who’s the other girl?  

LAMPITO  
 A noble girl, by the two gods, from Corinth.  

CALONICE [inspecting the girl’s bosom and buttocks]  
 A really noble girl, by Zeus—it’s clear  
 she’s got good lines right here, back here as well.                                        

LAMPITO  
 All right, who’s the one who called the meeting            
 and brought this bunch of women here?  

LYSISTRATA  
 I did.  

LAMPITO  
 Then lay out what it is you want from us.  

MYRRHINE  
 Come on, dear lady, tell us what’s going on,  
 what’s so important to you.  

LYSISTRATA  
 In a minute.  
 Before I say it, I’m going to ask you  
 one small question.  

CALONICE  
 Ask whatever you want.  

LYSISTRATA  
 Don’t you miss the fathers of your children  
 when they go off to war? I understand                                                                                   
 you all have husbands far away from home.                                                     

CALONICE  
 My dear, it’s five full months my man’s been gone—  
 off in Thrace taking care of Eucrates.  

MYRRHINE  
 And mine’s been off in Pylos seven whole months.[^note-508]  

LAMPITO  
 And mine—as soon as he gets home from war  
 he grabs his shield and buggers off again.  

LYSISTRATA  
 As for old flames and lovers—they’re none left.  
 And since Milesians went against us,  
 I’ve not seen a decent eight-inch dildo.  
 Yes, it’s just leather, but it helps us out.[^note-509]                                                                               
 So would you be willing, if I found a way,                                                           
 to work with me to make this fighting end?  

MYRRHINE  
 By the twin goddesses, yes. Even if 
 in just one day I had to pawn this dress 
 and drain my purse.  

CALONICE  
 Me too—they could slice me up  
 like a flat fish, then use one half of me 
 to get a peace.  

LAMPITO  
 I’d climb up to the top  
 of Taygetus to get a glimpse of peace.[^note-510]  

LYSISTRATA  
 All right I’ll tell you. No need to keep quiet  
 about my plan. Now, ladies, if we want                                                                                 
 to force the men to have a peace, well then,                                                    
 we must give up . . . 

MYRRHINE [interrupting]  
 Give up what? Tell us!  

LYSISTRATA  
 Then, will you do it?  

MYRRHINE  
 Of course, we’ll do it,  
 even if we have to die.            

LYSISTRATA  
 All right then—  
 we have to give up all male penises.  

[The women react with general consternation]  

 Why do you turn away? Where are you going?  
 How come you bite your lips and shake your heads?  
 And why so pale? How come you’re crying like that?  
 Will you do it or not? What will it be?  

MYRRHINE  
 I won’t do it. So let the war drag on.  

CALONICE  
 I won’t either. The war can keep on going.                   

LYSISTRATA  
 How can you say that, you flatfish? Just now  
 you said they could slice you into halves.  

CALONICE  
 Ask what you like, but not that! If I had to,  
 I’d be willing to walk through fire—sooner that  
 than give up screwing. There’s nothing like it,  
 dear Lysistrata.  

LYSISTRATA  
 And what about you?  

MYRRHINE  
 I’d choose the fire, too.  

LYSISTRATA  
 What a debased race  
 we women are! It’s no wonder men write  
 tragedies about us. We’re good for nothing  
 but screwing Poseidon in the bath tub.                                                                  
 But my Spartan friend, if you were willing,                                                                         
 just you and me, we still could pull it off.  
 So help me out.  

LAMPITO  
 By the twin gods, it’s hard  
 for women to sleep all by themselves  
 without a throbbing cock. But we must try.  
 We’ve got to have a peace.  

LYSISTRATA  
 O you’re a true friend!  
 The only real woman in this bunch.  

CALONICE  
 If we really do give up what you say—  
 I hope it never happens!—would doing that  
 make peace more likely?  

LYSISTRATA  
 By the two goddesses, yes,                                       
 much more likely. If we sit around at home  
 with all our make up on and in those gowns  
 made of Amorgos silk, naked underneath,                                                                        
 with our crotches neatly plucked, our husbands  
 will get hard and want to screw. But then,  
 if we stay away and won’t come near them,  
 they’ll make peace soon enough. I’m sure of it.  

LAMPITO  
 Yes, just like they say—when Menelaus 
 saw Helen’s naked tits, he dropped his sword.[^note-511]  

CALONICE  
 But my friend, what if our men ignore us?                                                         

LYSISTRATA  
 Well then, in the words of Pherecrates,  
 you’ll find another way to skin the dog.[^note-512]  

CALONICE  
 But fake penises aren’t any use at all.  
 What if they grab us and haul us by force                                                                           
 into the bedroom.  

LYSISTRATA  
 Just grab the door post.  

CALONICE  
 And if they beat us?  

LYSISTRATA  
 Then you must submit—  
 but do it grudgingly, don’t cooperate.  
 There’s no enjoyment for them when they just  
 force it in. Besides, there are other ways  
 to make them suffer. They’ll soon surrender.                                                  
 No husband ever had a happy life  
 if he did not get on well with his wife.  

CALONICE  
 Well, if you two think it’s good, we do, too.  

LAMPITO  
 I’m sure we can persuade our men to work  
 for a just peace in everything, no tricks.  
 But how’ll you convince the Athenian mob?                                                                    
 They’re mad for war.  

LYSISTRATA  
 That’s not your worry.  
 We’ll win them over.  

LAMPITO  
 I don’t think so—  
 not while they have triremes under sail  
 and that huge treasure stashed away                                            
 where your goddess makes her home.[^note-513]  

LYSISTRATA  
 But that’s all been well taken care of.  
 Today we’ll capture the Acropolis.  
 The old women have been assigned the task.  
 While we sit here planning all the details,  
 they’ll pretend they’re going there to sacrifice  
 and seize the place.  

LAMPITO  
 You’ve got it all worked out.                                                                      
 What you say sounds good.  

LYSISTRATA  
 All right Lampito,  
 let’s swear an oath as quickly as we can.  
 That way we’ll be united.  

LAMPITO  
 Recite the oath.                                                                             
 Then we’ll all swear to it.  

LYSISTRATA  
 That’s good advice.  
 Where’s that girl from Scythia? 

[The Scythian slave steps forward. She’s holding a small shield]  

 Why stare like that?  
 Put down your shield, the hollow part on top.  
 Now, someone get me a victim’s innards.  

CALONICE  
 Lysistrata, what sort of oath is this  
 we’re going to swear?  

LYSISTRATA  
 What sort of oath?  
 One on a shield, just like they did back then  
 in Aeschylus’ play—with slaughtered sheep.  

CALONICE  
 You can’t, Lysistrata, not on a shield,  
 you can’t swear an oath for peace on that.                   

LYSISTRATA  
 What should the oath be, then?  

CALONICE  
 Let’s get a stallion,  
 a white one, and then offer up its guts!  

LYSISTRATA  
 Why a white horse?  

CALONICE  
 Then how will we make our oath?  

LYSISTRATA  
 I’ll tell you, by god, if you want to hear.  
 Put a large dark bowl down on the ground,  
 then sacrifice a jug of Thasian wine,  
 and swear we’ll never pour in water.  

LAMPITO  
 Now, if you ask me, that’s a super oath!  

LYSISTRATA  
 Someone get the bowl and a jug of wine.  

[The Scythian girl goes back in the house and returns with a bowl 
and a jug of wine. Calonice takes the bowl]  

CALONICE  
 Look, dear ladies, at this splendid bowl.                   
 Just touching this gives instant pleasure.  

LYSISTRATA  
 Put it down. Now join me and place your hands  
 on our sacrificial victim.  

[The women gather around the bowl and lay their hands on the 
wine jug. Lysistrata starts the ritual prayer]  

 O you,  
 Goddess of Persuasion and the bowl  
 which we so love, accept this sacrifice,  
 a women’s offering, and be kind to us.  

[Lysistrata opens the wine jug and lets the wine pour out into the bowl]  

CALONICE  
 Such healthy blood spurts out so beautifully!  

LAMPITO  
 By Castor, that’s a mighty pleasant smell.  

MYRRHINE  
 Ladies, let me be the first to swear the oath.  

CALONICE  
 No, by Aphrodite, no—not unless                                                
 your lot is drawn.  

LYSISTRATA [holds up a bowl full of wine]  
 Grab the brim, Lampito,  
 you and all the others. Someone repeat                                                                                
 for all the rest of you the words I say—  
 that way you’ll pledge your firm allegiance:  
 No man, no husband and no lover . . . 

CALONICE [taking the oath]  
 No man, no husband and no lover . . . 

LYSISTRATA  
. . . will get near me with a stiff prick. . . Come on,  
 say it!  

CALONICE  
. . . will get near me with a stiff prick.  
 O Lysistrata, my knees are getting weak!  

LYSISTRATA  
 At home I’ll live completely without sex . . .                                                      

CALONICE  
 At home I’ll live completely without sex . . .  

LYSISTRATA  
. . . wearing saffron silks, with lots of make up . . .  

CALONICE  
. . . wearing saffron silks, with lots of make up . . .                                                   

LYSISTRATA  
. . . to make my man as horny as I can.  

CALONICE  
. . . to make my man as horny as I can.  

LYSISTRATA  
 If against my will he takes me by force . . . 

CALONICE  
 If against my will he takes me by force . . . 

LYSISTRATA  
. . . I’ll be a lousy lay, not move a limb.  

CALONICE  
. . . I’ll be a lousy lay, not move a limb.  

LYSISTRATA  
 I’ll not raise my slippers up towards the roof . . .                                          

CALONICE  
 I’ll not raise my slippers up towards the roof . . .                                                        

LYSISTRATA  
. . . nor crouch down like a lioness on all fours.  

CALONICE  
      . . . nor crouch down like a lioness on all fours. 

LYSISTRATA  
 If I do all this, then I may drink this wine.  

CALONICE  
 If I do all this, then I may drink this wine.  

LYSISTRATA  
 If I fail, may this glass fill with water.  

CALONICE  
 If I fail, may this glass fill with water.  

LYSISTRATA  
 Do all you women swear this oath?  

ALL  
 We do.  

LYSISTRATA  
 All right. I’ll make the offering.  

[Lysistrata drinks some of the wine in the bowl]  

CALONICE  
 Just your share,  
 my dear, so we all stay firm friends.   

[A sound of shouting is heard from offstage]  

LAMPITO  
 What’s that noise?                   

LYSISTRATA  
 It’s what I said just now—the women  
 have already captured the Acropolis.  
 So, Lampito, you return to Sparta—  
 do good work among your people there.  
 Leave these women here as hostages.  
 We’ll go in the citadel with the others  
 and help them barricade the doors.  

CALONICE  
 Don’t you think the men will band together  
 and march against us—and quickly, too.  

LYSISTRATA  
 I’m not so worried about them. They’ll come                               
 carrying their torches and making threats,  
 but they’ll not pry these gates of ours apart,                                                                    
 not unless they agree to our demands.  

CALONICE  
 Yes, by Aphrodite, that’s right. If not,  
 we’ll be labelled weak and gutless women.  

[The women enter the citadel. The Chorus of Old Men enters slowly, 
for they are quite decrepit. They are carrying wood for a fire, 
glowing coals to start the blaze, and torches to light.]  
      
 LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Keep moving, Draces, pick up the pace,  
 even if your shoulder’s tired lugging  
 all this heavy fresh-cut olive wood.  

CHORUS OF OLD MEN  
 Alas, so many unexpected things 
 take place in a long life. O Strymodorus,                           `               `                 
 who’d ever think they’d hear such news  
 about our women—the ones we fed                                                                                          
 in our own homes are truly bad.  
 The sacred statue is in their hands,  
 they’ve seized my own Acropolis  
 and block the doors with bolts and bars.  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Come on Philurgus, let’s hurry there  
 as fast as we can go up to the city.  
 We’ll set these logs down in a circle,  
 stack them so we keep them bottled up,                                                             `  
 those women who’ve combined to do this.  
 Then with our own hands we’ll set alight  
 a single fire and, as we all agreed  
 in the vote we took, we’ll burn them all,  
 beginning first with Lycon’s wife.[^note-514]                                                                                               

CHORUS OF OLD MEN  
 They’ll won’t be making fun of me, 
 by Demeter, not while I’m still alive.  
 That man Cleomenes, who was the first  
 to take our citadel, went back unharmed.  
 Snorting Spartan pride he went away,                                                                       
 once he’d handed me his weapons,  
 wearing a really tiny little cloak,  
 hungry, filthy, with his hairy face.  
 He’d gone six years without a bath.[^note-515]                                                                                           

 That’s how I fiercely hemmed him in,  
 our men in ranks of seventeen  
 we even slept before the gates.  
 So with these foes of all the gods  
 and of Euripides, as well, 
 will I not check their insolence?                                                                                    
 If I do not, then let my trophies 
 all disappear from Marathon.[^note-516]  

 The rest of the journey I have to make  
 is uphill to the Acropolis.  
 We must move fast, but how do we haul  
 this wood up there without a donkey?  
 This pair of logs makes my shoulders sore.  
 But still we’ve got to soldier on  
 giving our fire air to breathe.  
 It may go out when I’m not looking                                             
 just as I reach my journey’s end.  

[They blow on the coals to keep them alight. The smoke comes blowing up in their faces. The Old Men fall back, coughing and rubbing their eyes]  

 O the smoke!  

 Lord Hercules, how savagely  
 it jumped out from the pot right in my face  
 and bit my eyes like a raving bitch.  
 It works just like a Lemnian fire                                                                                                    
 or else it wouldn’t use its teeth  
 to feed on fluids in my eye.  
 We need to hurry to the citadel  
 and save the goddess. If not now,  
 O Laches, when should we help her out?[^note-517]                                                            

[The men blow on the coals and are again overpowered by the smoke]  

 Damn and blast this smoke!  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Thanks to the gods, the fire’s up again—  
 a lively flame. So what if, first of all, 
 we placed our firewood right down here, then put  
 a vine branch in the pot, set it alight,  
 and charged the door like a battering ram?  
 We’ll order women to remove the bars,                                                                                
 and, if they refuse, we’ll burn down the doors.  
 We’ll overpower them with the smoke.  
 All right, put down your loads.  

[The men set down their logs. Once again the smoke is too much for them]  

 This bloody smoke!                                                
 Is there any general here from Samos  
 who’ll help us with this wood?[^note-518]  

[He sets down his load of wood]  

 Ah, that’s better.  
 They’re not shrinking my spine any more.  
 All right, pot, it’s now your job to arouse  
 a fire from those coals, so first of all,  
 I’ll have a lighted torch and lead the charge.  
 O lady Victory, stand with us here,  
 so we can set our trophy up in there,  
 defeat those women in our citadel  
 put down this present insolence of theirs.                                                           

[The Old Men stack their logs in a pile and start lighting their torches 
on the coals. The Chorus of Old Women enters. They are carrying 
pitchers of water]  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Ladies, I think I see some flames and smoke,  
 as if a fire was burning. We’d better hurry.                                      `               `                 

CHORUS OF OLD WOMEN  
 We have to fly, Nicodice, fly  
 before Critylla is burned up  
 and Calyce, too, by nasty winds  
 and old men keen to wipe them out.  
 But I’m afraid I’ll be too late  
 to help them out. I’ve only just  
 filled up my pitcher in the dark.  
 It was not easy—at the well                                                          
 the place was jammed and noisy too  
 with clattering pots, pushy servants,  
 and tattooed slaves. But I was keen  
 to carry water to these fires  
 to help my country’s women.  

 I’ve heard some dim and dull old men  
 are creeping here and carrying logs—  
 a great big load—to our fortress,  
 as if to warm our public baths.  
 They’re muttering the most awful things                                      
 how with their fire they need to turn                                                                                       
 these hateful women into ash.  
 But, goddess, may I never see  
 them burned like that—but witness how  
 they rescue cities, all of Greece,  
 from war and this insanity.  
 That’s why, golden-crested goddess  
 who guards our city, these women  
 now have occupied your shrine.  
 O Tritogeneia, I summon you                                                      
 to be my ally—if any man  
 sets them on fire, help us out  
 as we carry this water up.[^note-519]  

[The Old Men have lit their torches and are about to move against 
the Acropolis. The Old Women are blocking their way]  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Hold on, ladies. What this I see? Men—                                                                              
 dirty old men—hard at work. Honest types,  
 useful, god-fearing men, could never do  
 the things you do.  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 What’s happening here  
 is something we did not expect to see—  
 a swarm of women standing here like this  
 to guard the doors.  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 So you’re afraid of us?                                                        
 Does it look like there’s a huge crowd of us?  
 You’re seeing just a fraction of our size—  
 there are thousands more.  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Hey there, Phaedrias!  
 Shall we stop her nattering on like this?  
 Someone hit her, smack her with a log.  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Let’s put our water jugs down on the ground,  
 in case they want to lay their hands on us.  
 Down there they won’t get in our way.  

[The Old Women set down their water jugs]  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 By god, someone should hit them on the jaw,                                                                
 two or three times, and then, like Boupalus,                                                    
 they’ll won’t have anything much more to say.[^note-520]  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Come on then—strike me. I’m here, waiting.  
 No other bitch will ever grab your balls.  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Shut up, or I hit you—snuff out your old age.  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Try coming up and touching Stratyllis  
 with your finger tips!  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 What if I thrashed you  
 with my fists? Would you do something nasty?  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 With my teeth I’ll rip out your lungs and guts!  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Euripides is such a clever poet—  
 the man who says there’s no wild animal                                     
 more shameless than a woman.  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Come on then,  
 Rhodippe, let’s pick up our water jugs.                                                                                   

[The Old Women pick up their water jugs again]  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Why have you damned women even come here  
 carrying this water?  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 And why are you  
 bringing fire, you old corpse? Do you intend  
 to set yourself on fire?  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Me? To start a blaze  
 and roast your friends.  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 I’m here to douse your fire.  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 You’ll put out my fire?  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Yes I will. You’ll see.  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS [waving his torch]  
 I don’t know why I’m not just doing it,  
 frying you in this flame.  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Get yourself some soap.                                                    
 I’m giving you a bath.  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 You’ll wash me,  
 you old wrinkled prune?  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Yes, it will be  
 just like your wedding night.  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Listen to her!  
 She’s a nervy bitch!  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 I’m a free woman.  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 I’ll make you shut up!  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 You don’t judge these things.                                                                    

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Set her hair on fire!  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Get to work, Achelous.[^note-521]  

[She throws her jar of water over the Leader of the Men’s Chorus, and,  
following the leader’s example the women throw water all over the old men]  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 O, that’s bad!  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Was that hot enough?  

[The women continue to throw water on the old men]  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Hot enough?  
 Won’t you stop doing that? What are you doing?  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 I’m watering you to make you bloom.  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 I’m too old and withered. I’m shaking.                                                                   

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Well, you’ve got your fire. Warm yourselves up.  

[A Magistrate enters with an armed escort of four public guards and 
slaves with crowbars and some attendant soldiers]  

MAGISTRATE  
 Has not our women’s lewdness shown itself  
 in how they beat their drums for Sabazius,  
 that god of excess, or on their rooftops  
 shed tears for Adonis? That’s what I heard                                                                         
 one time in our assembly. Demostrates—         
 what a stupid man he is—was arguing  
 that we should sail to Sicily. Meanwhile,  
 his wife was dancing round and screaming out  
      “Alas, Adonis!” While Demostrates talked,                                                         
 saying we should levy soldiers from Zacynthus,  
 the woman was on the roof top, getting drunk  
 and yelling out “Weep for Adonis! Weep.”[^note-522]  
 But he kept on forcing his opinion through,  
 that mad brutal ox, whom the gods despise.  
 That’s just the kind of loose degenerate stuff  
 that comes from women.  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Wait until I tell you  
 the insolent things these women did to us—  
 all their abuse—they dumped their water jugs                                                               
 on us. So now we have to dry our clothes.                                                          
 We look as if we’ve pissed ourselves.  

MAGISTRATE  
 By Poseidon,  
 god of the salt seas, it serves you right.  
 We men ourselves share in the blame for this.  
 We teach our wives their free and easy life,  
 and so intrigues come flowering out from them.  
 Here’s what we tell some working artisan,  
      “O goldsmith, about that necklace I bought here—  
 last night my wife was dancing and the bolt                                                                    
 slipped from its hole. I have to take a boat  
 to Salamis. If you’ve got time tonight,                                                                     
 you could visit her with that tool of yours  
 and fix the way the bolt sits in her hole.”  
 Another man goes to the shoemaker,  
 a strapping lad with an enormous prick,  
 and says, “O shoemaker, a sandal strap  
 is pinching my wife’s tender little toe.  
 Could you come at noon and rub her strap,  
 stretch it really wide?” That’s the sort of thing                                                               
 that leads to all this trouble. Look at me,  
 a magistrate in charge of finding oars                                          
 and thus in need of money now—these women  
 have shut the treasury doors to keep me out.  
 But standing here’s no use.  

[He calls out to his two slaves]  

 Bring the crow bars.  
 I’ll stop these women’s insolence myself.  

[He turns to the armed guards he has brought with him]  

 What are you gaping at, you idiot!  
 And you—what are you looking at?  
 Why are you doing nothing—just staring round  
 looking for a tavern? Take these crowbars  
 to the doors there, and then pry them open.  
 Come, I’ll work to force them with you.                                                                

LYSISTRATA [opening the doors and walking out]  
 No need to use those crowbars. I’m coming out—                                                    
 and of my own free will. Why these crowbars?  
 This calls for brains and common sense, not force.  

MAGISTRATE  
 Is that so, you slut? Where’s that officer?  
 Seize that woman! Tie her hands!  

LYSISTRATA  
 By Artemis, 
 he may be a public servant, but if  
 he lays a finger on me, he’ll be sorry.  

MAGISTRATE [to the first armed guard]  
 Are you scared of her? Grab her round the waist!  
 You there, help him out! And tie her up!  

OLD WOMAN A[^note-523]  
 By Pandrosus, if you lift a hand to her,                                                                  
 I’ll beat you until you shit yourself!                                                                                            

[The armed guard is so terrified he shits]  

MAGISTRATE  
 Look at the mess you made! Where is he,  
 that other officer?  

[The Magistrate turns to a third armed officer]  

 Tie up this one first,  
 the one who’s got such a dirty mouth.  

OLD WOMAN B  
 By the god of light, if you just touch her,  
 you’ll quickly need a cup to fix your eyes.[^note-524]  

[This officer shits his pants and runs off. The Magistrate turns 
to a fourth officer]  

MAGISTRATE  
 Who’s this here? Arrest her! I’ll put a stop  
 to all women in this demonstration!  

OLD WOMEN C  
 By bull-bashing Artemis, if you move  
 to touch her, I’ll rip out all your hair                                             
 until you yelp in pain.  

[The fourth officer shits himself and runs off in terror]  

MAGISTRATE  
 This is getting bad.  
 There’re no officers left. We can’t let ourselves                                                            
 be beaten back by women. Come on then, 
 you Scythians, form up your ranks.[^note-525]   Then charge.  
 Go at them!  

LYSISTRATA  
 By the two goddesses, you’ll see—  
 we’ve got four companies of women inside,  
 all fighting fit and fully armed.  

MAGISTRATE  
 Come on, 
 Scythians, twist their arms behind them!  

LYSISTRATA [shouting behind her]  
 Come out here from where you are in there,  
 all you female allies, on the double—                                           
 you market women who sell grain and eggs,  
 garlic and vegetables, and those who run  
 our bakeries and taverns, to the attack!  

[Many women emerge from the Acropolis, armed in various ways]  

 Hit them, stomp on them, scratch their eyeballs,  
 cover them with your abuse! Don’t hold back!                                                               

[A general tumult occurs in which the women beat back the 
Scythian guards]  

LYSISTRATA  
 That’s enough! Back off! Don’t strip the armour  
 from those you have defeated.  

[The armed women return into the Acropolis]  

MAGISTRATE  
 Disaster!  
 My guards have acted quite disgracefully.  

LYSISTRATA  
 What did you expect? Did you really think  
 you were facing a bunch of female slaves?                                                         
 Or is it your belief that mere women  
 have no spirit in them?  

MAGISTRATE  
 Spirit? By Apollo, yes! 
 If they’re near any man who’s got some wine.  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 In this land you’re a magistrate, but here  
 your words are useless. Why even try  
 to have a conversation with these bitches?  
 Don’t you know they’ve just given us a bath  
 in our own cloaks? And they did not use soap!                                                             

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Listen, friend. You should never raise your hand  
 against your neighbour. If you do, then I                                     
 will have to punch you in the eye. I’d prefer  
 to sit quietly at home, like a young girl,  
 and not come here to injure anyone  
 or agitate the nest, unless someone  
 disturbs the hive and makes me angry.  

CHORUS OF OLD MEN  
 O Zeus, however will we find a way  
 to deal with these wild beasts? What’s going on  
 is no longer something we can bear.  
 But we must question them and find out why  
 they are so angry with us, why they wish                    
 to seize the citadel of Cranaus, 
 the holy ground where people do not go,  
 on the great rock of the Acropolis.[^note-526]  

LEADER OF THE MEN’S CHORUS [to Magistrate]  
 So ask her. Don’t let them win you over.  
 Challenge everything they say. If we left  
 this matter without seeking out the cause  
 that would be disgraceful.  

MAGISTRATE [turning to Lysistrata]  
 Well then, by god,  
 first of all I’d like to know the reason  
 why you planned to use these barriers here  
 to barricade our citadel.  

LYSISTRATA  
 To get your money                                   
 so you couldn’t keep on paying for war.  

MAGISTRATE  
 Is it money that’s the cause of war?  

LYSISTRATA  
 Yes, and all the rest of the corruption.  
 Peisander and our leading politicians                                                                                     
 need a chance to steal. That’s the reason  
 they’re always stirring up disturbances.[^note-527]  
 Well, let the ones who wish to do this  
 do what they want, but from this moment on  
 they’ll get no more money.  

MAGISTRATE  
 What will you do?  

LYSISTRATA  
 You ask me that? We’ll control it.  

MAGISTRATE  
 You mean                                         
 you’re going to manage all the money?  

LYSISTRATA  
 You consider that so strange? Isn’t it true  
 we take care of all the household money?  

MAGISTRATE  
 That’s not the same.  

LYSISTRATA  
 Why not?  

MAGISTRATE  
 We need the cash  
 to carry on the war.  
LYSISTRATA  
 Well, first of all,  
 there should be no fighting.  
MAGISTRATE  
 But without war  
 how will we save ourselves?  
LYSISTRATA  
 We’ll do that.  
MAGISTRATE  
 You?  
LYSISTRATA  
 That’s right—us.  
MAGISTRATE  
 This is outrageous!  
LYSISTRATA  
 We’ll save you,  
 even if that goes against your wishes.  
MAGISTRATE  
 What you’re saying is madness!  
LYSISTRATA  
 You’re angry,                                                                       
 but nonetheless we have to do it.  
MAGISTRATE  
 By Demeter, this is against the law!                                                                                           
LYSISTRATA        
 My dear fellow, we have to rescue you.  
MAGISTRATE  
 And if I don’t agree?  
LYSISTRATA  
 Then our reasons  
 are that much more persuasive.  
MAGISTRATE  
 Is it true  
 you’re really going to deal with peace and war? 
LYSISTRATA  
 We’re going to speak to that.  
MAGISTRATE [with a threatening gesture]  
 Then speak fast,  
 or else you may well start to cry.  
LYSISTRATA  
 Then listen—  
 and try to keep your fists controlled.  
MAGISTRATE  
 I can’t.  
 It’s hard for me to hold back my temper.                                                                   
LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 It’s more likely you’re the one who’ll weep.  
MAGISTRATE  
 Shut up your croaking, you old bag.  
[To Lysistrata]  
 You—talk to me.  
LYSISTRATA  
 I’ll do that. Up to now through this long war  
 we kept silent about all those things  
 you men were doing. We were being modest.  
 And you did not allow us to speak up,  
 although we were not happy. But still,  
 we listened faithfully to you, and often                                                                      
 inside the house we heard your wretched plans  
 for some great deed. And if we ached inside,                                                   
 we’d force a smile and simply ask, “Today  
 in the assembly did the men propose  
 a treaty carved in stone decreeing peace?”  
 But our husbands said, “Is that your business?  
 Why don’t you shut up?” And I’d stay silent.  
OLD WOMAN  
 I’d not have kept my mouth shut.  
MAGISTRATE [to Lysistrata]  
 You’d have been smacked  
 if you hadn’t been quiet and held your tongue.  
LYSISTRATA  
 So there I am at home, saying nothing.  
 Then you’d tell us of another project,  
 even stupider than before. We’d say,                                     `                                 
 “How can you carry out a scheme like that?  
 It’s foolish.” Immediately he’d frown  
 and say to me, “If you don’t spin your thread,  
 you’ll get a major beating on your head.                                                                              
 War is men’s concern.”  
MAGISTRATE           
 Yes, by god!  
 That man spoke the truth.  
LYSISTRATA  
 You idiot!  
 Is that sensible—not to take advice  
 when what you’re proposing is so silly?  
 Then we heard you speaking in the streets,  
 asking openly, “Are there any men                                              
 still left here in our land?” and someone said,  
      “By god, there’s no one.” Well then, after that  
 it seemed to us we had to rescue Greece  
 by bringing wives into a single group  
 with one shared aim. Why should we delay?  
 If you’d like to hear us give some good advice,  
 then start to listen, keep your mouths quite shut,  
 the way we did. We’ll save you from yourselves.  
MAGISTRATE  
 You’ll save us? What you’re saying is madness.  
 I’m not going to put up with it!  
LYSISTRATA  
 Shut up!                                                                 
MAGISTRATE  
 Should I shut up for you, you witch, someone                                                               
 with a scarf around her head? I’d sooner die!  
LYSISTRATA  
 If this scarf of mine really bothers you,  
 take it and wrap it round your head. Here—  
[Lysistrata takes off her scarf and wraps it over the Magistrate’s head.]  
 Now keep quiet!  
OLD WOMAN A  
 And take this basket, too!  
LYSISTRATA  
 Now put on a waist band, comb out wool, 
 and chew some beans. This business of the war  
 we women will take care of.  
LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Come on, women,  
 get up and leave those jars. It’s our turn now                                                                 
 to join together with our friends.                                                                                  
WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 With dancing I’ll never tire  
 weariness won’t grip my knees  
 or wear me out. In everything  
 I’ll strive to match the excellence  
 of these women here—in nature,  
 wisdom, boldness, charm, 
 and prudent virtue in the way  
 they love their country.  
LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 You grandchildren of the bravest women,  
 sprung from fruitful stinging nettles,                                                                        
 let your passion drive you forward  
 and don’t hold back, for now you’ve got  
 the winds of fortune at your back.                                                                                              
LYSISTRATA  
 O Aphrodite born on Cyprus  
 and, you, sweet passionate Eros, breathe  
 sexual longing on our breasts and thighs  
 and fill our men with tortuous desire  
 and make their pricks erect. If so, I think  
 we’ll win ourselves a name among the Greeks  
 as those who brought an end to warfare.                                                              
MAGISTRATE  
 What will you do?  
LYSISTRATA  
 For a start, we’ll stop  
 you men hanging around the market place  
 armed with spears and acting up like fools.  
OLD WOMAN A  
 Yes, that’s right, by Paphian Aphrodite!  
LYSISTRATA  
 Right now in the market they stroll around  
 among the pots and vegetables, fully armed,  
 like Corybantes.[^note-528]  
MAGISTRATE  
 Yes, that’s right—  
 it’s what brave men should do.  
LYSISTRATA  
 It looks so silly—  
 going off to purchase tiny little birds  
 while carrying a Gorgon shield.[^note-529]                                                                                      
OLD WOMAN A  
 By god,                                                                           
 I myself saw a cavalry commander—  
 he had long hair and was on horseback—  
 pouring out some pudding he’d just bought  
 from an old woman into his helmet.  
 Another Thracian was waving his spear  
 and his shield, as well, just like Tereus,  
 and terrifying the woman selling figs  
 while gobbling down the ripest ones she had.[^note-530]  
MAGISTRATE  
 And how will you find the power to stop  
 so many violent disturbances                                                       
 throughout our states and then resolve them?  
LYSISTRATA  
 Very easily.  
MAGISTRATE  
 But how? Explain that.  
LYSISTRATA  
 It’s like a bunch of yarn. When it’s tangled,  
 we take it and pass it through the spindle  
 back and forth—that’s how we’ll end the war,  
 if people let us try, by sending out                                                                                             
 ambassadors here and there, back and forth.  
MAGISTRATE  
 You’re an idiot! Do you really think 
 you can end such fearful acts with spindles,  
 spools, and wool? 
LYSISTRATA  
 If you had any common sense,                                        
 you’d deal with everything the way we do  
 when we handle yarn.  
MAGISTRATE  
 What does that mean?  
 Tell me.  
LYSISTRATA  
 First of all, just as we wash the wool  
 in a rinsing tub to remove the dirt,  
 you have to lay the city on a bed,  
 beat out the rascals, and then drive away  
 the thorns and break apart the groups of men  
 who join up together in their factions  
 seeking public office—pluck out their heads.  
 Then into a common basket of good will                                     
 comb out the wool, the entire compound mix,  
 including foreigners, guests, and allies,                                                                                 
 anyone useful to the public good.  
 Bundle them together. As for those cities  
 which are colonies of this land, by god,  
 you must see that, as far as we’re concerned,  
 each is a separate skein. From all of them,  
 take a piece of wool and bring it here.  
 Roll them together into a single thing.  
 Then you’ll have made one mighty ball of wool,                                          
 from which the public then must weave its clothes.  
MAGISTRATE  
 So women beat wool and roll it in balls!  
 Isn’t that wonderful? That doesn’t mean  
 they bear any part of what goes on in war.  
LYSISTRATA  
 You damned fool, of course it does—we endure  
 more than twice as much as you. First of all,  
 we bear children and then send them off  
 to serve as soldiers.  
MAGISTRATE  
 All right, be quiet.                                                                                      
 Don’t remind me of all that.  
LYSISTRATA  
 And then,  
 when we should be having a good time,                                                                
 enjoying our youth, we have to sleep alone  
 because our men are in the army.  
 Setting us aside, it distresses me  
 that young unmarried girls are growing old  
 alone in their own homes.  
MAGISTRATE  
 Don’t men get old?  
LYSISTRATA  
 By god, that’s not the same at all. For men,  
 even old ones with white hair, can come back  
 and quickly marry some young girl. For women  
 time soon runs out. If they don’t seize their chance,  
 no one wants to marry them—they sit there                                
 waiting for an oracle.  
MAGISTRATE  
 But an old man  
 who can still get his prick erect . . .  
LYSISTRATA [interrupting]  
 O you—  
 why not learn your lesson and just die? It’s time.                                                       
 Buy a funeral urn. I’ll prepare the dough  
 for honey cakes.[^note-531]   Take this wreath.  
[Lysistrata throws some water over the Magistrate]  
OLD WOMAN A  
 This one, too—  
 it’s from me!  
[Old Woman A throws more water on the Magistrate]  
OLD WOMAN B  
 Here, take this garland!  
[Old Woman B throws more water on the Magistrate]  
LYSISTRATA  
 Well now,  
 what do you need? What are you waiting for?  
 Step aboard the boat. Charon’s calling you.  
 You’re preventing him from casting off.[^note-532]  
MAGISTRATE  
 I don’t have to put up with these insults!                                                              
 I’ll go to the other magistrates, by god,  
 and show myself exactly as I am!                                                                                                  
[The Magistrate exits with his attending slaves]  
LYSISTRATA [calling out to him as he leaves]  
 Are you blaming us for not laying you out  
 for burial? Well then, on the third day,  
 we’ll come and offer up a sacrifice  
 on your behalf first thing in the morning.  
[Lysistrata and the old women with her return inside the Acropolis]  
LEADER OF THE MEN’S CHORUS  
 You men, no more sleeping on the job  
 for anyone born free! Let’s strip ourselves  
 for action on this issue. It seems to me  
 this business stinks—it’s large and getting larger.                                        
[The Old Men strip down, taking almost all their clothes off]  
CHORUS OF OLD MEN  
 And I especially smelled some gas—  
 the tyrant rule of Hippias.  
 I’ve a great fear that Spartan men  
 collected here with Cleisthenes,  
 have with their trickery stirred up  
 these women, whom the gods all hate,  
 to seize the treasury and our pay,  
 the funds I need to live my way.[^note-533]  
 It’s terrible these women here  
 are thinking about politics                                                            
 and prattling on about bronze spears—  
 they’re women!—and making peace  
 on our behalf with Spartan types,  
 whom I don’t trust, not any more  
 than gaping wolves. In this affair,  
 those men are weaving plots for us,                                                                                          
 so they can bring back tyranny.  
 But me, I won’t give any ground,  
 not to a tyrant. I’ll stand guard,  
 from now on carrying a sword                                                      
 inside my myrtle bough. I’ll march  
 with weapons in the market place  
 with Aristogeiton at my side.[^note-534]  
 I’ll stand with him. And now it’s time  
 I struck those hostile to gods’ law  
 and hit that old hag on the jaw.  
[The Old Men move to threaten the Old Women with their fists]  
LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 When you get back home, your own mother  
 won’t know who you are. Come on, old ladies,  
 you friends of mine, let’s first set our burdens  
 on the ground. 
WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 All you fellow citizens,                                                            
 we’ll start to give the city good advice  
 and rightly, since it raised us splendidly                                                                               
 so we lived very well. At seven years old,  
 I carried sacred vessels, and at ten  
 I pounded barley for Athena’s shrine.  
 Later as bear, I shed my yellow dress  
 for the rites of Brauronian Artemis.  
 And once I was a lovely full-grown girl,  
 I wore strings of figs around my neck 
 and was one of those who carried baskets.[^note-535]                                                        
 So I am indebted to the city.  
 Why not pay it back with good advice?  
 I was born a woman, but don’t hold that  
 against me if I introduce a plan  
 to make our present situation better.                                                                                       
 For I make contributions to the state—  
 I give birth to men. You miserable old farts,  
 you contribute nothing! That pile of cash  
 which we collected from the Persian Wars  
 you squandered. You don’t pay any taxes.                                                          
 What’s more, the way you act so stupidly  
 endangers all of us. What do you say?  
 Don’t get me riled up. I’ll take this filthy shoe  
 and smack you one right on the jaw.  
CHORUS OF OLD MEN  
 Is this not getting way too insolent?  
 I think it’s better if we paid them back.                                                                                 
 We have to fight this out. So any one  
 who’s got balls enough to be a man  
 take off your clothes so we men can smell  
 the way we should—like men. We should strip.                                            
 It’s not right to keep ourselves wrapped up.  
 We’re the ones who’ve got white feet.  
 We marched to Leipsydrion years ago.[^note-536]  
 And now let’s stand erect again, aroused  
 in our whole bodies—shake off our old age.                                                                    
[The Old Men take off their remaining clothes, hold up their shrivelled 
phalluses, and threaten the women]  
 If one of us gives them the slightest chance  
 there’s nothing these women won’t continue  
 trying to work on—building fighting ships,  
 attacking us at sea like Artemesia.[^note-537]  
 If they switch to horses, I draw the line.                                                                
 For women are the best at riding bareback—  
 their shapely arses do a lovely job.  
 They don’t slip off when grinding at a gallop.  
 Just look how Micon painted Amazons  
 fighting men on horseback hand to hand.[^note-538]  
 So we must take a piece of wood with holes,                                                                   
 and fit a yoke on them, around their necks.  
CHORUS OF OLD WOMEN  
 By the two goddesses, if you get me roused,  
 I’ll let my wild sow’s passion loose and make  
 you yell to all the people here today                                             
 how I’m removing all your hair.  
LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 You ladies,  
 let’s not delay—let’s take off all our clothes,  
 so we can smell a woman’s passion  
 when we’re in a ferocious mood.  
[The Old Women take off their clothes]  
WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Now let any man step out against me—  
 he won’t be eating garlic any more,                                                                                           
 and no black beans. Just say something nasty,  
 I’m so boiling mad, I’ll treat you the same way  
 the beetle did the eagle—smash your eggs.[^note-539]  
LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS      
 Not that I give a damn for you, not while                                     
 I have Lampito here—Ismenia, too,  
 my young Theban friend. You have no power,  
 not even with seven times as many votes.  
 You’re such a miserable old man, even those  
 who are you neighbours find you hateful.  
 Just yesterday for the feast of Hecate,                                                                                      
 I planned a party, so I asked my neighbours  
 in Boeotia for one of their companions,  
 a lovely girl—she was for my children—  
 a splendid pot of eels.[^note-540]   But they replied                                       
 they couldn’t send it because you’d passed  
 another one of your decrees. It doesn’t seem  
 you’ll stop voting in these laws, not before  
 someone takes your leg, carries you off  
 and throws you out.  
      
[Lysistrata comes out from the Acropolis, looking very worried and angry.  
 The leader of the Women’s Chorus addresses her]  
 Here’s our glorious leader,  
 who does the planning for this enterprise.  
 Why have you come here, outside the building,  
 and with such a sad expression on your face?  
LYSISTRATA  
 It’s the way these women act so badly,  
 together with their female hearts, that makes                              
 me lose my courage and walk in circles.  
LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 What are you saying? What do you mean?                                                                       
LYSISTRATA  
 It’s true, so true.  
LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 What’s wrong? You can tell us—  
 we’re friends of yours.  
LYSISTRATA  
 I’m ashamed to say, 
 but it’s hard to keep it quiet.  
LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Don’t hide from me  
 bad news affecting all of us.  
LYSISTRATA  
 All right,  
 I’ll keep it short—we all want to get laid.  
LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 O Zeus!  
LYSISTRATA  
 What’s the point of calling Zeus?  
 There’s nothing he can do about this mess.  
 I can’t keep these women from their men,                                                         
 not any longer—they’re all running off.  
 First I caught one slipping through a hole                                                                           
 beside the Cave of Pan, then another  
 trying it with a rope and pulley, a third  
 deserting on her own, and yesterday  
 there was a woman on a giant bird 
 intending to fly down to that place  
 run by Orsilochus.[^note-541]   
 I grabbed her hair.  
 They’re all inventing reasons to go home.  
[A woman come out of the citadel, trying to sneak off]  
 Here’s one of them on her way right now.                                                          
 Where do you think you’re going?  
WOMAN A  
 Who me?  
 I want to get back home. Inside the house  
 I’ve got bolts of Milesian cloth, and worms  
 are eating them.  
LYSISTRATA  
 What worms? Get back in there!                                                                        
WOMAN A  
 I’ll come back right away, by god—I just  
 need to spread them on the bed.  
LYSISTRATA  
 Spread them?  
 You won’t be doing that. You’re not leaving!  
WOMAN A  
 My wool just goes to waste?  
LYSISTRATA  
 If that’s what it takes.  
[Woman A trudges back into the Acropolis. Woman B emerges]  
WOMAN B  
 I’m such a fool, I’ve left my wretched flax  
 back in my house unstripped.  
LYSISTRATA  
 Another one                                     
 leaving here to go and strip her flax!  
 Get back inside!  
WOMAN B  
 By the goddess of light,  
 I’ll be right back, once I’ve rubbed its skin.  
LYSISTRATA  
 You’ll not rub anything. If you start that,                                                                            
 some other woman will want to do the same.  
[Woman B returns dejected into the citadel. Woman C emerges 
from the citadel, looking very pregnant]  
WOMAN C  
 O sacred Eileithia, goddess of birth,  
 hold back my labour pains till I can find  
 a place where I’m permitted to give birth.[^note-542]  
LYSISTRATA  
 What are you moaning about?  
WOMAN C  
 It’s my time—  
 I’m going to have a child!  
LYSISTRATA  
 But yesterday                                              
 you weren’t even pregnant. 
WOMAN C  
 Well, today I am. 
 Send me home, Lysistrata, and quickly.  
 I need a midwife.  
LYSISTRATA [inspecting Woman C’s clothing]  
 What are you saying?    
 What’s this you’ve got here? It feels quite rigid.  
WOMAN C  
 A little boy.  
LYSISTRATA  
 No, by Aphrodite,  
 I don’t think so. It looks like you’ve got                                                                                
 some hollow metal here. I’ll have a look.  
[Lysistrata looks under the woman’s dress and pulls out a helmet]  
 You silly creature, you’ve got a helmet there,  
 Athena’s sacred helmet. Didn’t you say  
 you were pregnant.  
WOMAN C  
 Yes, and by god, I am.                                                                         
LYSISTRATA  
 Then why’ve you got this helmet?  
WOMAN C  
 Well, in case  
 I went into labour in the citadel.  
 I could give birth right in the helmet,  
 lay it in there like a nesting pigeon.  
LYSISTRATA  
 What are you talking about? You’re just  
 making an excuse—that’s so obvious.  
 You’ll stay here for at least five days  
 until your new childs birth is purified.  
WOMAN C  
 I can’t get any sleep in the Acropolis,  
 not since I saw the snake that guards the place.                                            
[More women start sneaking out of the citadel]  
WOMAN D                       
 Nor can I. I’m dying from lack of sleep                                                                                  
 those wretched owls keep hooting all the time.  
LYSISTRATA  
 Come on ladies, stop all these excuses!  
 All right, you miss your men. But don’t you see  
 they miss you, too? I’m sure the nights they spend  
 don’t bring them any pleasure. But please, dear friends,  
 hold on—persevere a little longer.  
 An oracle has said we will prevail,  
 if we stand together. That’s what it said.  
WOMAN A  
 Tell us what it prophesied.  
LYSISTRATA  
 Then, keep quiet.                                                            
      “When the sparrows, as they fly away,                                                                                    
 escaping from the hoopoe birds, shall stay  
 together in one place and shall say nay  
 to sexual encounters, then a bad day  
 will be rare. High thundering Zeus will say  
     ‘What once was underneath on top I’ll lay.’“
WOMAN B [interrupting]  
 Women are going to lie on top of men?  
LYSISTRATA [continuing the oracle]  
      ” . . . but if the sparrows fight and fly away  
 out of the holy shrine, people will say  
 no bird is more promiscuous than they.”                                                              
WOMAN A  
 That oracle is clear enough, by god.  
LYSISTRATA  
 All you heavenly gods, can we stop talking  
 of being in such distress. Let us go back in.  
 For, my dearest friends, it will be a shame  
 if we don’t live up to this prophecy.                                                                                           
[Lysistrata and the women go back into the citadel, leaving the two  
choruses]  
MEN’S CHORUS  
 I’d like to tell you all a tale,  
 which I heard once when I was young  
 about Melanion, a young lad  
 who fled from marriage and then came  
 into the wilds and so he lived                                                       
 up in the hills. He wove some nets                                                                                             
 and hunted hares. He had a dog.  
 Not once did he return back home  
 He hated women—they made him sick.  
 And we are no less wise than he.  
LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Let’s kiss, old bag, give it a try.  
LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 You won’t need onions to make you cry.  
LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 I’ll lift my leg—give you a kick.  
LEADER OF WOMAN’S CHORUS  
 Down there your pubic hair’s too thick.                                                                                
LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Myronides had a hairy dick                                                           
 and beat foes with his big black bum.  
 That Phormio was another one.[^note-543]  
WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 To you I’d like to tell a tale  
 to answer your Melanion.  
 There was a man called Timon once,  
 a vagabond, the Furies’ child.  
 Wild thistles covered his whole face.                                                                                        
 He wandered off filled up with spite  
 and always cursing evil types.  
 But though he always hated men,                                                                                
 those of you who are such rogues,  
 women he always really loved.                                                                                                       
LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 You’d like a punch right on the chin?  
LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Not given the state of fear I’m in.  
LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 What if I kicked you with my toe?  
LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 We’d see your pussy down below. 
LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 And then you’d see, although I’m old  
 it’s not all matted hair down there,  
 but singed by lamp and plucked with flair.  
[Lysistrata appears on a balcony of the citadel, looking off in 
the distance. Other women come out after her]  
LYSISTRATA  
 Hey, you women! Over here to me. Come quick!                                     
CALONICE  
 What’s going on? Why are you shouting?                                                                           
LYSISTRATA  
 A man!  
 I see a man approaching mad with love,  
 seized with desire for Aphrodite’s rites.  
 O holy queen of Cyprus, Cythera,  
 and Paphos, keep moving down the road,  
 the straight path you’ve been travelling on. 
CALONICE  
 Where is he, whoever he is?  
LYSISTRATA  
 Over there,  
 right beside the shrine of Chloe.  
CALONICE  
 Oh yes,  
 there he is, by god. Who is he?  
LYSISTRATA  
 Have a look.  
 Do any of you know him?  
MYRRHINE  
 O god, I do.                                                                    
 It’s my husband Cinesias.  
LYSISTRATA  
 All right,  
 your job is to torment him, be a tease,  
 make him hot, offer to have sex with him                                                                          
 and then refuse, try everything you can,  
 except the things you swore to on the cup.  
MYRRHINE  
 Don’t you worry. I’ll do that.  
LYSISTRATA  
 All right, then.  
 I’ll stay here to help you play with him.  
 We’ll warm him up together. You others,  
 go inside.  
[The women go inside, including Myrrhine. Cinesias enters with 
a very large erection. An attendant comes with him carrying a 
young baby]  
CINESIAS  
 I’m in a dreadful way.  
 It’s all this throbbing. And the strain. I feel                                  
 as if I’m stretched out on the rack.  
LYSISTRATA  
 Who’s there,  
 standing inside our line of sentinels?  
CINESIAS  
 It’s me.  
LYSISTRATA  
 A man?  
CINESIAS  
 Yes, take a look at this!  
LYSISTRATA  
 In that case leave. Go on your way.  
CINESIAS  
 Who are you  
 to tell me to get out?  
LYSISTRATA  
 The daytime watch.  
CINESIAS  
 Then, by the gods, call Myrrhine for me.                                                                            
LYSISTRATA  
 You tell me to summon Myrrhine for you?  
 Who are you?  
CINESIAS  
 Cinesias, her husband,  
 from Paeonidae.[^note-544]  
LYSISTRATA  
 Welcome, dear friend, your name  
 is not unknown to us. Your wife always                                       
 has you on her lips. Any time she licks  
 an apple or an egg she says, “Ah me,  
 if only this could be Cinesias.”  
[Lysistrata licks her fist obscenely]  
CINESIAS  
 O my god!  
LYSISTRATA  
 Yes, by Aphrodite, yes. And when our talk  
 happens to deal with men, your wife speaks up  
 immediately, “O they’re all useless sorts                                                                              
 compared to my Cinesias.”  
CINESIAS  
 Please call her out.  
LYSISTRATA  
 Why should I do that? What will you give me?  
CINESIAS  
 Whatever you want, by god. I have this . . .  
[Cinesias waves his erection in front of Lysistrata]  
 I’ll give you what I’ve got.    
LYSISTRATA  
 No thanks.                                                      
 I think I’ll tell her to come out to you.  
[Lysistrata leaves to fetch Myrrhine]  
CINESIAS  
 Hurry up. I’ve had no pleasure in life  
 since she’s been gone from home. I go out,  
 but I’m in pain. To me now everything  
 seems empty. There’s no joy in eating food.  
 I’m just so horny. 
[Lysistrata appears dragging Myrrhine with her. Myrrhine is 
pretending to be reluctant]  
MYRRHINE [loudly so that Cinesias can hear]  
 I love him. I do. 
 But he’s unwilling to make love to me,                                                                                  
 to love me back. Don’t make me go to him.  
CINESIAS  
 O my dear sweetest little Myrrhine,  
 what are you doing? Come down here.                                                                  
MYRRHINE  
 I’m not going there, by god.  
CINESIAS  
 If I ask you,  
 won’t you come down, Myrrhine?  
MYRRHINE  
 You’ve got no reason to be calling me.  
 You don’t want me.  
CINESIAS  
 You don’t think I want you?  
 I’m absolutely dying for you!  
MYRRHINE  
 I’m leaving.  
CINESIAS  
 Hold on! You might want to hear our child.  
 Can you call out something to your mama?  
CHILD  
 Mummy, mummy, mummy!  
CINESIAS  
 What’s wrong with you?                                                              
 Don’t you feel sorry for the boy. It’s now  
 six days since he’s been washed or had some food.                                   
MYRRHINE  
 Ah yes, I pity him. But it’s quite clear  
 his father doesn’t.  
CINESIAS  
 My lovely wife,  
 come down here to the child.  
MYRRHINE  
 Being a mother  
 is so demanding. I better go down.  
 What I put with!  
[Myrrhine starts coming down from the Acropolis accentuating 
the movement of her hips as she goes]  
CINESIAS  
 She seems to me  
 to be much younger, easier on the eyes.  
 She was acting like a shrew and haughty,  
 but that just roused my passion even more.  
MYRRHINE [to the child]  
 My dear sweet little boy. But your father—  
 such rotten one. Come here. I’ll hold you.                   
 Mummy’s little favourite.  
CINESIAS  
 You dim-witted girl,  
 what are you doing, letting yourself  
 be led on by these other women,  
 causing me grief and injuring yourself?  
MYRRHINE  
 Don’t lay a hand on me!  
CINESIAS  
 Inside our home  
 things are a mess. You stopped doing anything.  
MYRRHINE  
 I don’t care.  
CINESIAS  
 You don’t care your weaving  
 is being picked apart by hens?  
MYRRHINE  
 So what?  
CINESIAS  
 You haven’t honoured holy Aphrodite  
 by having sex, not for a long time now.                                                                
 So won’t you come back?  
MYRRHINE  
 No, by god, I won’t—                                                                   
 unless you give me something in return.  
 End this war.  
CINESIAS  
 Well now, that’s something I’ll do,  
 when it seems all right.                      
MYRRHINE  
 Well then, I’ll leave here,  
 when it seems all right. But now I’m under oath.  
CINESIAS  
 At least lie down with me a little while.  
MYRRHINE  
 I can’t. I’m not saying I wouldn’t like to.  
CINESIAS  
 You’d like to? Then, my little Myrrhine,  
 lie down right here.  
MYRRHINE  
 You must be joking—  
 in front of our dear baby child?  
CINESIAS  
 No, by god.                                                                               
[Cinesias turns toward the attendant]  
 Manes, take the boy back home. All right then,  
 the lad’s no longer in the way. Lie down.  
MYRRHINE  
 But, you silly man, where do we do it?                                                                                   
CINESIAS  
 Where? The Cave of Pan’s an excellent place.  
MYRRHINE  
 How will I purify myself when I return  
 into the citadel?  
CINESIAS  
 You can wash yourself  
 in the water clock. That would do the job.  
MYRRHINE  
 What about the oath I swore? Should I become  
 a wretched perjurer?  
CINESIAS  
 I’ll deal with that.  
 Don’t worry about the oath.  
MYRRHINE  
 Well then,                                                                        
 I’ll go and get a bed for us.  
CINESIAS  
 No, no.  
 The ground will do.  
MYRRHINE  
 No, by Apollo, no!  
 You may be a rascal, but on the ground?  
 No, I won’t make you lie down there.  
[Myrrhine goes back into the Acropolis to fetch a bed]  
CINESIAS  
 Ah, my wife—  
 she really loves me. That’s so obvious.  
[Myrrhine reappears carrying a small bed]  
MYRRHINE  
 Here we are. Get on there while I undress.                                                                       
 O dear! I forgot to bring the mattress.  
CINESIAS  
 Why a mattress? I don’t need that.  
MYRRHINE  
 You can’t lie  
 on the bed cord. No, no, by Artemis,  
 that would be a great disgrace.  
CINESIAS  
 Give me a kiss—                                             
 right now!  
MYRRHINE [kissing him]  
 There you go.  
[Myrrhine goes back to the Acropolis to fetch the mattress]  
CINESIAS 
 Oh my god—  
 get back here quickly!  
[Myrrhine reappears with the mattress]   
MYRRHINE  
 Here’s the mattress.  
 You lie down on it. I’ll get my clothes off.  
 O dear me! You don’t have a pillow.  
CINESIAS  
 But I don’t need a pillow!  
MYRRHINE  
 By god, I do.  
[Myrrhine goes back to the Acropolis for a pillow]  
CINESIAS  
 This cock of mine is just like Hercules—  
 he’s being denied his supper.[^note-545]  
[Myrrhine returns with a pillow]  
MYRRHINE  
 Lift up a bit.  
 Come on, up! There, I think that’s everything. 
CINESIAS  
 That’s all we need. Come here, my treasure.                                                                   
MYRRHINE  
 I’m taking off the cloth around my breasts.                                                       
 Now, don’t forget. Don’t you go lying to me  
 about that vote for peace.  
CINESIAS  
 O my god,  
 may I die before that happens!  
MYRRHINE  
 There’s no blanket.  
CINESIAS  
 I don’t need one, by god! I want to get laid!  
MYRRHINE  
 Don’t worry. You will be. I’ll be right back.  
[Myrrhine goes back to the Acropolis to fetch a blanket]  
CINESIAS  
 That woman’s killing me with all the bedding!  
[Myrrhine returns with a blanket]  
MYRRHINE  
 All right, get up.  
CINESIAS  
 But it’s already up!  
MYRRHINE  
 You want me to rub some scent on you?  
CINESIAS  
 No, by Apollo. Not for me.  
MYRRHINE                  
 I’ll do it,  
 whether you want it rubbed on there or not—                             
 for Aphrodite’s sake. 
[Myrrhine goes back to the Acropolis to get the perfume]  
CINESIAS  
 O great lord Zeus,                                                                                      
 pour the perfume out! 
[Myrrhine returns with the perfume]  
MYRRHINE  
 Hold out your hand, now.  
 Take that and spread it round.  
CINESIAS [rubbing the perfume on himself]  
 By Apollo,  
 this stuff doesn’t smell so sweet, not unless  
 it’s rubbed on thoroughly—no sexy smell.  
MYRRHINE [inspecting the jar of perfume]  
 I’m such a fool. I brought the Rhodian scent!  
CINESIAS  
 It’s fine. Just let it go, my darling.  
MYRRHINE [getting up to leave]  
 You’re just saying that.  
[Myrrhine goes back to the Acropolis to get the right perfume]  
CINESIAS  
 Damn the wretch who first came up with perfume!  
[Myrrhine comes back from the Acropolis with another box of perfume]  
MYRRHINE  
 Grab this alabaster thing.  
CINESIAS [waving his cock]  
 You grab this alabaster cock. 
 Come lie down here, you tease. Don’t go and fetch                      
 another thing for me.      
MYRRHINE 
 By Artemis, I’ll grab it.  
 I’m taking off my shoes. Now, my darling,                                                                        
 you will be voting to bring on a peace. 
CINESIAS  
 I’m planning to.  
[Myrrhine goes back to the Acropolis. Cinesias turns and sees she’s gone]  
 That woman’s killing me!  
 She teased me, got me all inflamed, then left.  
[Cinesias gets up and declaims in a parody of tragic style]  
 Alas, why suffer from such agony?  
 Who can I screw? Why’d she betray me,  
 the most beautiful woman of them all?  
 Poor little cock, how can I care for you?  
 Where’s that Cynalopex? I’ll pay him well                                    
 to nurse this little fellow back to health.[^note-546]  
LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 You poor man, in such a fix—your spirit  
 so tricked and in distress. I pity you.                                                                                         
 How can your kidneys stand the strain,  
 your balls, your loins, your bum, your brain  
 endure an erection that’s hard for you,  
 without a chance of a morning screw.  
CINESIAS        
 O mighty Zeus, it’s started throbbing once again.  
LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 A dirty stinking bitch did this to you.  
CINESIAS  
 No, by god, a loving girl, a sweet one, too.                   
LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Sweet? Not her. She’s a tease, a slut.  
CINESIAS  
 All right, she is a tease, but—  
 O Zeus, Zeus, I wish 
 you’d sweep her up there  
 in a great driving storm,  
 like dust in the air,  
 whirl her around,  
 then fall to the ground. 
 Then as she’s carried down,  
 to earth one more time,                                                                                                         
 let her fall right away 
 on this pecker of mine.  
[Enter the Spartan herald. He, too, has a giant erection, which he 
is trying to hide under his cloak]  
SPARTAN HERALD  
 Where’s the Athenian Senate and the Prytanes?[^note-547]                                                        
 I come with fresh dispatches.  
CINESIAS [looking at the Herald’s erection]  
 Are you a man,  
 or some phallic monster?  
SPARTAN HERALD  
 I’m a herald,  
 by the twin gods. And my good man,  
 I come from Sparta with a proposal,  
 arrangements for a truce.  
CINESIAS  
 If that’s the case,  
 why do you have a spear concealed in there?  
SPARTAN HERALD  
 I’m not concealing anything, by god.                                                                       
CINESIAS  
 Then why are you turning to one side?  
 What that thing there, sticking from your cloak?  
 Has your journey made your groin inflamed?  
SPARTAN HERALD  
 By old Castor, this man’s insane!  
CINESIAS  
 You rogue,  
 you’ve got a hard on!  
SPARTAN HERALD  
 No I don’t, I tell you.                                                                             
 Let’s have no more nonsense.  
CINESIAS [pointing to the herald’s erection]  
 Then what’s that?  
SPARTAN HERALD  
 It’s a Spartan herald’s stick.  
CINESIAS  
 O that’s what it is,  
 a Spartan herald stick. Let’s have a chat.  
 Tell me the truth. How are things going for you  
 out there in Sparta?  
SPARTAN HERALD  
 Not good. The Spartans                                      
 are all standing tall and the allies, too—  
 everyone is firm and hard. We need a thrust  
 in someone’s rear.[^note-548]   

CINESIAS  
 This trouble of yours—  
 where did it come from? Was it from Pan?[^note-549]  

SPARTAN HERALD  
 No. I think it started with Lampito.  
 Then, at her suggestion, other women 
 in Sparta, as if from one starting gate,  
 ran off to keep men from their honey pots.[^note-550]                                                                    

CINESIAS  
 How are you doing?  

SPARTAN HERALD  
 We’re all in pain.  
 We go around the city doubled up,                                                                            
 like men who light the lamps.[^note-551]  The women  
 won’t let us touch their pussies, not until  
 we’ve made a peace with all of Greece.  

CINESIAS  
 This matter  
 is a female plot, a grand conspiracy  
 affecting all of Greece. Now I understand.  
 Return to Sparta as fast as you can go.  
 Tell them they must send out ambassadors                                           
 with full authority to deal for peace.  
 I’ll tell out leaders here to make a choice  
 of our ambassadors. I’ll show them my prick.                                                  

SPARTAN HERALD  
 All you’ve said is good advice. I must fly.  

[Cinesias and the Spartan Herald exit in opposite directions]      

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 There’s no wild animal harder to control  
 than women, not even blazing fire.  
 The panther itself displays more shame.  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 If you know that, then why wage war with me?  
 You old scoundrel, we could be lasting friends.  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 But my hatred for women will not stop!  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 Whatever you want. But I don’t much like  
 to look at you like this, without your clothes.                                                                 
 It makes me realize how silly you are.                                                                    
 Look, I’ll come over and put your shirt on.  

[The Leader of the Women’s Chorus picks up a tunic, goes over to 
the Leader of the Men’s Chorus, and helps him put it on.]  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 By god, what you’ve just done is not so bad.  
 I took it off in a fit of stupid rage. 

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 Now at least you look like a man again.  
 And people won’t find you ridiculous.  
 If you hadn’t been so nasty to me,  
 I’d grab that insect stuck in your eye  
 and pull it out. It’s still in there.  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 So that’s what’s been troubling me. Here’s a ring.  
 Scrape it off. Get it out and show it to me.                                                         
 God, that’s been injuring my eye for ages.  

[The Leader of the Women’s Chorus takes the ring and inspects 
the Leader of the Men’s Chorus in the eye]  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 I’ll do it. You men are born hard to please.                                                                       
 My god, you picked up a monstrous insect.  
 Have a look. That’s a Tricorynthus bug![^note-552]  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 By Zeus, you’ve been a mighty help to me.  
 That thing’s been digging wells in me a while.  
 Now it’s been removed, my eyes are streaming.  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 I’ll wipe it for you, though you’re a scoundrel.  
 I’ll give you a kiss.  

LEADER OF THE MEN’S CHORUS  
 I don’t want a kiss.  

LEADER OF WOMEN’S CHORUS  
 I’ll will, whether it’s what you want or not.                                                         

[She kisses him]  

LEADER OF MEN’S CHORUS  
 O you’ve got me. You’re born to flatter us.  
 That saying got it right—it states the case  
 quite well, “These women—one has no life  
 with them, and cannot live without them.”  
 But now I’ll make a truce with you. I won’t                                                                       
 insult you any more in days to come,  
 and you won’t make me suffer. So now,  
 let’s make a common group and sing a song.  

[The Men’s and Women’s Choruses combine]  

COMBINED CHORUS [addressing the audience]  
 You citizens, we’re not inclined  
 with any of you to be unkind.                                                                                          
 Just the reverse—our words to you  
 will be quite nice. We’ll act well, too.  
 For now we’ve had enough bad news.  
 So if a man or woman here                                                                                                                
 needs ready cash, give out a cheer,  
 and take some minae, two or three.  
 Coins fill our purses now, you see.  
 And if we get a peace treaty,  
 you take some money from the sack,  
 and keep it. You don’t pay it back.                                                                             

 I’m going to have a great shindig—  
 I’ve got some soup, I’ll kill a pig—  
 with Carystian friends, all good men.[^note-553]                   ``                                                              
 You’ll eat fine tender meat again.  
 Come to my house this very day.  
 But first wash all the dirt away,  
 you and your kids, then walk on by.  
 No need to ask a person why.  
 Just come straight in, as if my home  
 was like your own—for at my place                    
 we’ll shut the door right in your face.  

[A group of Spartans enters]  

LEADER OF THE CHORUS  
 Ah, here come the Spartan ambassadors  
 trailing their long beards. They’ve got  
 something like a pig pen between their thighs.  

[The Spartan ambassadors enter, moving with difficulty because of 
their enormous erections.]  

 Men of Sparta, first of all, our greetings.  
 Tell us how you are. Why have you come?  

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR  
 Why waste a lot of words to tell you?  
 You see the state that brought us here.  

[The Spartans all display their erections with military precision]  

LEADER OF THE CHORUS  
 Oh my! The crisis has grown more severe.  
 It seems the strain is worse than ever.                                                                     

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR  
 It’s indescribable. What can I say?                                                                                              
 But let someone come, give us a peace  
 in any way he can.  

LEADER OF THE CHORUS  
 Well now, I see 
 our own ambassadors—they look just like  
 our wrestling men with their shirts sticking out  
 around their bellies or like athletic types  
 who need to exercise to cure their sickness.  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR  
 Where’s Lysistrata? Can someone tell me?  
 We’re men here and, well, look . . .  

[The Athenians pull back their cloaks and reveal that, like the 
Spartans, they all have giant erections]  

LEADER OF THE CHORUS 
 They’re clearly suffering from the same disease.                                          
 Hey, does it throb early in the morning?  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR  
 By god, yes. What this is doing to me— `                                                                             
 it’s torture. If we don’t get a treaty soon  
 we’ll going to have to cornhole Cleisthenes.[^note-554]  

LEADER OF THE CHORUS  
 If you’re smart, keep it covered with your cloak.  
 One of those men who chopped off Hermes’ dick  
 might see you.[^note-555]  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR [pulling his cloak over his erection]  
 By god, that’s good advice.  

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR [doing the same]  
 Yes, by the twin gods, excellent advice.  
 I’ll pull my mantle over it.  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR  
 Greetings, Spartans.  
 We’re both suffering disgracefully.                                                                             

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR  
 Yes, dear sir, we’d have been in real pain  
 if one of those dick-clippers had seen us  
 with our peckers sticking up like this.  
      
ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR  
 All right, Spartans, we each need to talk.                                                                            
 Why are you here?  

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR  
 Ambassadors for peace.  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR  
 Well said. We want the same. Why don’t we call  
 Lysistrata. She’s the only one who’ll bring  
 a resolution to our differences.  

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR  
 By the two gods, bring in Lysistratus,  
 if he’s the one you want.                                                               

[Lysistrata emerges from the gates of the citadel]  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR  
 It seems there is no need to summon her.  
 She’s heard us, and here she is in person.  

LEADER OF THE CHORUS  
 Hail to the bravest woman of them all.  
 You must now show that you’re resilient— 
 stern but yielding, with a good heart but mean, 
 stately but down-to-earth. The foremost men  
 in all of Greece in deference to your charms                                         
 have come together here before you  
 so you can arbitrate all their complaints.  

LYSISTRATA  
 That task should not be difficult, unless                                       
 they’re so aroused they screw each other.  
 I’ll quickly notice that. But where is she,  
 the young girl Reconciliation?  

[The personification of the the goddess Reconciliation comes out.  
She’s completely naked. Lysistrata addresses her first][^note-556]  

 Come here,  
 and first, take hold of those from Sparta,  
 don’t grab too hard or be too rough, not like  
 our men who act so boorishly—instead  
 do it as women do when they’re at home.  
 If they won’t extend their hands to you,  
 then grab their cocks.  

[Reconciliation takes two Spartans by their penises and leads them over to Lysistrata]  

 Now go and do the same                                                                 
 for the Athenians. You can hold them                                          
 by whatever they stick out.  

[Reconciliation leads the Athenians over to Lysistrata]  

 Now then,  
 you men of Sparta, stand here close to me,  
 and you Athenians over here. All of you,  
 listen to my words. I am a woman,  
 but I have a brain, and my common sense  
 is not so bad—I picked it up quite well  
 from listening to my father and to speeches  
 from our senior men. Now I’ve got you here,  
 I wish to reprimand you, both of you,  
 and rightly so. At Olympia, Delphi,                   
 and Thermopylae (I could mention  
 many other places if I had a mind  
 to make it a long list) both of you  
 use the same cup when you sprinkle altars,  
 as if you share the same ancestral group.[^note-557]  
 We’ve got barbarian enemies, and yet  
 with your armed expeditions you destroy  
 Greek men and cities. At this point, I’ll end  
 the first part of my speech.  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR  
 This erection—  
 it’s killing me!  

LYSISTRATA  
 And now you Spartans,                                                  
 I’ll turn to you. Don’t you remember how,  
 some time ago, Periclidias came,  
 a fellow Spartan, and sat down right here,  
 a suppliant at these Athenian altars—                                                                                    
 he looked so pale there in his purple robes—     
 begging for an army? Messenians then  
 were pressing you so hard, just at the time  
 god sent the earthquake. So Cimon set out  
 with four thousand armed infantry and saved  
 the whole of Sparta.[^note-558]   After going through that,                                             
 how can you ravage the Athenians’ land,  
 the ones who helped you out?  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR  
 Lysistrata,  
 you’re right, by god. They’re in the wrong. 

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR [looking at Reconciliation]  
 Not true,  
 but look at that incredibly fine ass!  

LYSISTRATA  
 Do you Athenians think I’ll forget you?  
 Don’t you remember how these Spartans men,                                                            
 back in the days when you were dressed as slaves  
 came here with spears and totally destroyed  
 those hordes from Thessaly and many friends  
 of Hippias and those allied with him?                                                                      
 It took them just one day to drive them out  
 and set you free. At that point you exchanged  
 your slavish clothes for cloaks which free men wear.  

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR  
 I’ve never seen a more gracious woman.  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR [looking at Reconciliation]  
 I’ve never seen a finer looking pussy.  

LYSISTRATA  
 If you’ve done many good things for each other,  
 why go to war? Why not stop this conflict?                                                                         
 Why not conclude a peace? What’s in the way?  

[In the negotiations which follow, the ambassadors use the body of 
Reconciliation as a map of Greece, pointing to various parts to 
make their points]  

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR  
 We’re willing, but the part that’s sticking out  
 we want that handed back.  

LYSISTRATA  
 Which one is that?                                                           

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR [pointing to Reconciliation’s buttocks]  
 This one here—that’s Pylos. We must have that—  
 we’ve been aching for it a long time now.[^note-559]  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR  
 By Poseidon, you won’t be having that!  

LYSISTRATA  
 My good man, you’ll surrender it to them.  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR  
 Then how do we make trouble, stir up shit?  

LYSISTRATA  
 Ask for something else of equal value.  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR 
[inspecting Reconciliation’s body and pointing to her public hair]  
 Then give us this whole area in here—  
 first, there’s Echinous, and the Melian Gulf,  
 the hollow part behind it, and these legs                                                                             
 which make up Megara.[^note-560]  

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR  
 By the twin gods,                                                             
 my good man, you can’t have all that!  

LYSISTRATA  
 Let it go.  
 Don’t start fighting over a pair of legs.  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR  
 I’d like to strip and start ploughing naked.  

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR  
 By god, yes! But me first. I’ll fork manure.  

LYSISTRATA  
 You can do those things once you’ve made peace.  
 If these terms seem good, you’ll want your allies  
 to come here to join negotiations.  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADORS  
 What of our allies? We’ve all got hard ons.  
 Our allies will agree this is just fine.  
 They’re all dying to get laid!              

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR  
 Ours, as well—                   
 no doubt of that.  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR  
 And the Carystians—  
 they’ll also be on board, by Zeus.  

LYSISTRATA  
 Well said. Now you must purify yourselves.  
 We women will host a dinner for you  
 in the Acropolis. We’ll use the food  
 we brought here in our baskets. In there  
 you will make a oath and pledge your trust  
 in one another. Then each of you  
 can take his wife and go back home.  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR  
 Let’s go—  
 and hurry up.  

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR [to Lysistrata]  
 Lead on. Wherever you wish.                                                          

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR  
 All right by Zeus, as fast as we can go.  

[Lysistrata and Reconciliation lead the Spartan and Athenian 
delegations into the Acropolis]  
                          
CHORUS  
 Embroidered gowns and shawls, 
 robes and golden ornaments—  
 everything I own—I offer you  
 with an open heart. Take these things  
 and let your children have them,  
 if you’ve a daughter who will be  
 a basket bearer. I tell you all  
 take my possessions in my home—  
 nothing is so securely closed                                                         
 you can’t break open all the seals  
 and take whatever’s there inside.                                                                                                 
 But if you look, you won’t see much  
 unless your eyesight’s really keen,  
 far sharper than my own.  

 If anyone is out of corn  
 to feed his many tiny children  
 and household slaves, at home  
 I’ve got a few fine grains of wheat—  
 a quart of those will make some bread,                                                                 
 a fresh good-looking loaf. If there’s a man  
 who wants some bread and is in need                                                                                    
 let him come with his sacks and bags  
 to where I live to get his wheat.  
 My servant Manes will pour it out.  
 But I should tell you not to come  
 too near my door—there’s a dog  
 you need to stay well clear of.  

ATHENIAN DELEGATE A [from inside the citadel]  
 Open the door! 

[The Athenian Delegate A comes staggering out of the citadel, evidently  
drunk. He’s carrying a torch. Other delegates in the same condition come 
out behind him. Athenian Delegate A bumps into someone by the door, 
probably one of a group of Spartan slaves standing around waiting for 
their masters to come out][^note-561]  

ATHENIAN DELEGATE A 
 Why don’t you get out of my way?  
 Why are you lot sitting there? What if I                                        
 burned you with this torch? That’s a stale routine![^note-562]  
 I won’t do that. Well, if I really must,  
 to keep you happy, I’ll go through with it.                                                                          

[Athenian Delegate A chases an onlooker away with his torch]  

ATHENIAN DELEGATE B [waving a torch]  
 We’ll be here with you to help you do it.  
 Why not just leave? You may soon be screaming  
 for that hair of yours.  

ATHENIAN DELEGATE A  
 Go on, piss off!  
 So the Spartans inside there can come on out  
 and go away in peace. 

[The two Athenian delegates force the Spartan slaves away from the door]  

ATHENIAN DELEGATE B  
 Well now,  
 I never seen a banquet quite like this.  
 The Spartans were delightful. As for us,  
 we had too much wine, but as companions                                  
 we said lots of really clever things.  

ATHENIAN DELEGATE A  
 That’s right. When we’re sober, we lose our minds.  
 I’ll speak up and persuade Athenians  
 what when our embassies go anywhere                                                                                
 they stay permanently drunk. As it is,  
 whenever we go sober off to Sparta,  
 right away we look to stir up trouble.  
 So we just don’t hear what they have to say  
 and get suspicious of what they don’t state.  
 Then we bring back quite different reports                                  
 about the same events. But now these things  
 have all been sorted out. So if someone there  
 sang “Telamon” when he should have sung  
      “Cleitagora,” we’d applaud the man  
 and even swear quite falsely that . . .[^note-563]  

[The Spartan slaves they forced away from the door are gradually coming back]  

 Hey, those slaves  
 are coming here again. You whipping posts,                                                     
 why can’t you go away?  

ATHENIAN DELEGATE B  
 By Zeus,  
 the ones in there are coming out again.  

[The Spartan delegates come out of the citadel. The Spartan 
ambassador is carrying a musical instrument]  

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR  
 Here, my dear sir, take this wind instrument,  
 so I can dance and sing a lovely song                                              
 to honour both Athenians and ourselves.  

ATHENIAN AMBASSADOR [turning to one of the slaves]  
 Yes, by the gods, take the pipes. I love  
 to see you Spartans dance and sing.  

[The music starts. The Spartan Ambassador sings and dances]  

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR  
 O Memory, to this young man  
 send down your child the Muse  
 who knows the Spartans and Athenians.[^note-564]                                                                          
 Back then at Artemesium  
 they fought the ships like gods of war  
 and overpowered the Medes,  
 while we, I know, led by Leonidas                                               
 whetted our teeth like boars  
 with foaming mouths, which dripped  
 down on our legs. The Persian force  
 possessed more fighting men  
 than grains of sea shore sand.                                                                                                        
 O Artemis, queen of the wild,  
 slayer of beasts, chaste goddess,  
 come here to bless our treaty,  
 to make us long united.  
 May our peace be always blessed                                                  
 with friendship and prosperity,  
 and may we put an end  
 to all manipulating foxes.                                                                                                                     
 Come here, O come here,  
 Virgin Goddess of the Hunt.  

[Lysistrata emerges from the citadel bringing all the wives with her]  

LYSISTRATA[^note-565]  
 Come now, since everything has turned out well,  
 take these women back with you, you Spartans.  
 And, you Athenians, these ones are yours.  
 Let each man stand beside his wife, each wife  
 beside her man, and then to celebrate                                         
 good times let’s dance in honour of the gods.  
 And for all future time, let’s never make  
 the same mistake again.  

[The Chorus now sings to the assembled group, as the wives and husbands are rejoined]  

CHORUS  
 Lead on the dance, bring on the Graces,  
 and summon Artemis and her twin,                                                                                         
 Apollo, the god who heals us all,  
 call on Bacchus, Nysa’s god, 
 whose eyes blaze forth  
 amid his Maenads’ ecstasy,  
 and Zeus alight with flaming fire,                                                                                 
 and Hera, Zeus’ blessed wife,  
 and other gods whom we will use  
 as witnesses who won’t forget  
 the meaning of the gentle Peace  
 made her by goddess Aphrodite.                                                                                                   

 Alalai! Raise the cry of joy,  
 raise it high, iai!  
 the cry of victory, iai!  
 Evoi, evoi, evoi, evoi!  

LYSISTRATA 
 Spartan, now offer us another song,                                                                         
 match our new song with something new.  

SPARTAN AMBASSADOR  
 Leave lovely Taygetus once again  
 and, Spartan Muse, in some way  
 that is appropriate for us  
 pay tribute to Amyclae’s god,  
 and to bronze-housed Athena, 
 to Tyndareus’ splendid sons,                                                                                                             
 who play beside the Eurotas.  
 Step now, with many a nimble turn,  
 so we may sing a hymn to Sparta,                                                                               
 dancing in honour of the gods,  
 with stamping feet in that place  
 where by the river Eurotas 
 young maidens dance,  
 like fillies raising dust,                                                                           
 tossing their manes,  
 like bacchants who play  
 and wave their thyrsus stalks,  
 brought on by Leda’s lovely child,  
 their holy leader in the choral dance.[^note-566]                                            

 But come let your hands bind up your hair.  
 Let your feet leap up like deer, sound out the beat  
 to help our dance. Sing out a song of praise  
 for our most powerful bronze-house goddess, 
 all-conquering Athena!  

[They all exit singing and dancing]  


 

[^note-501]: . . . at least she’s come: Lysistrata is complaining that if the city had called a major festival all the women would be in the streets enjoying themselves. But none of them, it seems, has answered her invitation to a meeting (as we find out a few lines further on).   

[^note-502]: . . . save the eels: At the time Lysistrata was first produced, the Athenians and Spartans had been fighting for many years. TheBoeotians were allies of the Spartans. Boeotia was famous for its eels, considered a luxury item in Athens.   

[^note-503]: . . . dye it yellow: The two goddesses are Demeter and her daughter Persephone. The Athenian women frequently invoke them.   

[^note-504]: Theogenes: a well-known merchant and ship owner.   

[^note-505]: . . . a stink: Calonice is making an obscure joke on the nameAnagyrus, a political district named after a bad-smelling plant.   

[^note-506]: LAMPITO: In Aristophanes’ text, Lampito and other Spartans use a parody of a Spartan dialect, a style of speaking significantly different from (although related to) Athenian Greek. Translators have dealt with this in different ways, usually by giving the Spartans a recognizable English dialect, for example, from the Southern States or Scotland, or English with a foreign accent. The difference between the Spartans’ speech and the language of the others reflects the political antagonism between the Athenians and Spartans. Here I have not tried to follow this trend. My main reasons for doing so are (in brief) that, first, some dialects are in places incomprehensible to some readers or have been made irrelevant (e.g., Jack Lindsay’s Scottish language in the Bantam edition of Aristophanes or the erratic Russian English of the Perseus translation) and, second, I wish to leave the choice of dialect or accent up to the imagination of the readers or the directors of stage productions (who might like to experiment with dialects which will connect with their particular audiences more immediately than any one I might select).   

[^note-507]: . . . the two gods: Spartans commonly invoke the divine twins Castor and Pollux, brothers of Helen and Clytaemnestra.    

[^note-508]: . . . after Eucrates: Thrace is a region to the north of Greece, a long way from Athens. Eucrates was an Athenian commander in the region. Pylos is a small area in the south Peloponnese which the Athenians had occupied for a number of years.   

[^note-509]: . . . went against us: Miletus had rebelled against Athens in the previous year. That city was associated with sexuality and (in this case) the manufacture of sexual toys.    

[^note-510]: . . . Taygetus: a high mountain in the Peloponnese.   

[^note-511]: . . . naked tits: In a famous story, Menelaus went storming through Troy looking for his wife, Helen, in order to kill her. But when he found her, he was so overcome by her beauty that he relented and took her back home to Sparta.   

[^note-512]: Pherecrates: an Athenian comic dramatist. The line may be a quotation from one of his plays.    

[^note-513]: . . . where your goddess makes her home: The financial reserves of the Athenian state were stored in the Acropolis   

[^note-514]: . . . Lycon’s wife: a woman in Athens famous for her promiscuity.    

[^note-515]: Cleomenes, a king of Sparta, once came with a small army to Athens (in 508) to help the oligarch party. He had a very hostile reception and took refuge in the Acropolis, where he stayed under siege for two days. A truce was arranged and the Spartans left peacefully.    

[^note-516]: . . . from Marathon: Euripides is the famous tragic dramatist, a younger contemporary of Aristophanes. Marathon was the site of the great Greek victory of the Persian expeditionary forces in 490 BC, a high point of Athenian military achievement.    

[^note-517]: . . . help her out: The reference to Lemnian fire is not clear. The island of Lemnos perhaps had some volcanic activity, or else the reference is to the women of Lemnos who killed all their husbands. There is a pun on the Greek word for Lemnos and the word in the same speech referring to material in the eye.   

[^note-518]: . . . Samos: Samos is an important island near Athens. A number of the generals of Athenian forces came from there.    

[^note-519]: Sommerstein observes (p. 171) that the epithet Tritogeneia (“Tritoborn”) refers to Athena’s birth beside the River Triton or Lake Tritonisin North Africa.    

[^note-520]: . . . much more to say: Boupalus was a sculptor from Chios.   

[^note-521]: . . . to work, Achelous: The Achelous was a large well-known river in northern Greece.    

[^note-522]: . . . Weep!”: Sabazius was a popular foreign god associated with drinking (like Dionysus). Adonis was a mortal youth loved by Aphrodite. An annual festival was celebrated in his memory. Demostrates was a politician promoting the disastrous Athenian military expedition to Sicily. Zacynthus is an island off the Peloponnese, an ally of Athens.    

[^note-523]: OLD WOMAN A: In modern productions the old women who speak in this scene either come out of the gates to the Acropolis or are members of the Chorus. Alternatively the speeches could be assigned to the characters we have met earlier (Myrrhine and Calonice), who have emerged from the Acropolis behind Lysistrata.    

[^note-524]: . . . fix your eyes: Black eyes were treated with a small cup placed over the eye to reduce the swelling.    

[^note-525]: Scythians: The armed guards accompanying the Magistrate are traditionally Scythian archers.    

[^note-526]: . . . of the Acropolis: Cranaus was a legendary king of Athens.    

[^note-527]: . . . up disturbances: Peisander was a leading Athenian politician, suspected of favouring the war for selfish reasons.    

[^note-528]: . . . Corybantes: Corybantes were divine attendants on the foreign goddess Cybele. They were associated with ecstatic music and dancing.   

[^note-529]: . . . Gorgon shield: Shields with monstrous Gorgon’s heads depicted on them were common in Athens.   

[^note-530]: Tereus: a mythical king of Thrace and a popular figure with Athenian dramatists.    

[^note-531]: honey cake: A honey cake was traditionally part of the funeral service. It was given to make sure the dead shade reached Hades.    

[^note-532]: Charon is the ferryman who transports the shades of the dead across the river into Hades.   

[^note-533]: Hippias . . . Cleisthenes . . . pay: Hippias was a tyrant in Athens from 528 to 510. Cleisthenes, an Athenian, was a favourite target of Aristophanes, ridiculed as a passive homosexual. Here there’s an accusation that he is sympathetic to the Spartans. The pay the old men refer to is a daily payment of three obols from the state to jury men.    

[^note-534]: Aritogeiton and his friend Harmodius assassinated the tyrant Hipparchus, the brother of Hippias. The two were celebrated as heroes of democratic Athens.   

[^note-535]: The Old Women are referring to many city activities and rituals in which girls of noble families played important roles. The phrase “pounding barley” refers to making cakes for sacrifices.       

[^note-536]: Leipsydrion was the site of a battle years before when the tyrant Hippias besieged and defeated his opponents. The old men are treating the event as if they had been victorious. The detail about their white feet, Sommerstein suggests, refers to those who were hostile to Hippias and the tyrants (hence, lovers of freedom).    

[^note-537]: Artemesia was queen of Halicarnassus in Asia Minor. She led ships from her city as part of the Persian expedition against Athens in 480 and fought at the Battle of Salamis.    

[^note-538]: Micon was a well-known Athenian painter.    

[^note-539]: beetle . . . eagle: This is a reference to an old story in which the dung beetle got its revenge against an eagle by smashing its eggs. The old woman obviously threatens the man’s testicles as she says this.    

[^note-540]: Hecate was a goddess whose worship was associated with birth and children.    

[^note-541]: Orsilochus is either a well known seducer or someone who keeps a brothel.    

[^note-542]: permitted to give birth: To have a child in a holy place, like the Acropolis, was considered a sacrilege.   

[^note-543]: Myronides and Phormio were two dead generals who fought for Athens.    

[^note-544]: Paeonidae: Sommerstein (p. 200) points out that Paeonidae is a political district in northern Attica. The name suggest the Greek verb paiein, meaning to strike or copulate. Sommerstein offers the translation “Bangwell.” Jack Lindsay translates the place as “Bangtown.”   

[^note-545]: Hercules was famous for always being hungry and having an enormous appetite .   

[^note-546]: Cynalopex (= “Fox Dog”) was the nickname of Philostratus who apparently was a pimp.    

[^note-547]: Prytanes was the business committee of the Athenian council.   

[^note-548]: . . . in someone’s rear: The Greek reads “we need Pellene,” an area in the Peloponnese allied with Sparta. But, as Sommerstein points out (p. 206), this is undoubtedly a pun invoking a word meaning vagina or anus. In the exchanges which follow, the Spartans are depicted as having a decided preference for anal sex.   

[^note-549]: Pan was a god associated with wild unrestrained sex in thewilderness .   

[^note-550]: honey pots: The meaning of the Greek word hussakos is very obscure.Sommerstein translates as “pork barrels.”   

[^note-551]: men who light the lamps: The lamplighters had to walk along bent over in order to protect the flame they carried.   

[^note-552]: Tricorynthus is a region in Attica, near Marathon. Presumably it was famous for its insects.   

[^note-553]: Carystus is a state from Euboea, allied to Athens.    

[^note-554]: Cleisthenes: a well known Athenian, whom Aristophanes frequently ridicules as a passive homosexual.    

[^note-555]: Hermes’ dick: In 415 the statues of Hermes in Athens were mutilated by having their penises chopped off, a very sacrilegious act .   

[^note-556]: Reconciliation: In Aristophanes’ time, this character would be played by a man with a body stocking prominently displaying female characteristics: breasts, pubic hair, buttocks.   

[^note-557]: Olympia, Delphi, Thermopylae: Lysistrata is listing some of the festivals where all the Greek states cooperated in the ritual celebrations.   

[^note-558]: . . . the whole of Sparta: In 464 Sparta suffered a massive earthquake, which killed many citizens. Their slaves, who included theMessenians, rose in revolt. Sparta appealed to Athens for help, and the Athenians, after some debate, sent Cimon with an army to assist the Spartans.    

[^note-559]: Pylos: a small but important part of the south Peloponnese which the Athenians had seized in 425 and held onto ever since.    

[^note-560]: Echinous . . . Melian Gulf . . . Megara: These are places relatively close to Athens.   

[^note-561]: . . . by the door: The stage business at this point is somewhat confusing. It’s not clear whether the Athenian delegates who now appear are leaving the meeting in the citadel or arriving and wanting to get in. Here I follow Sommerstein, who is following Henderson, and have the delegates emerge from the meeting. The people hanging around the door are probably the slaves who came with the Spartans and who are waiting for their masters inside.    

[^note-562]: . . . stale routine: This comment is taking a swipe at other comic dramatists who use a stock set of situations or actions, while at the same time the action uses the stock technique (not an uncommon feature of Aristophanic comedy).    

[^note-563]: ”Telamon” and “Cleitagora” are well known drinking songs.    

[^note-564]: The Spartan Ambassador is singing about two famous battles against the Persians (both in 480), the Athenian naval victory at Artemisiumand the Spartan stand of the 300 at Thermopylae. This military campaign was an important highlight of Greek unity.    

[^note-565]: There is some dispute about who this speech should be assigned to. Sommerstein (p. 221) has a useful summary of the arguments.    

[^note-566]: *Taygetus* is an important mountain in Sparta. *Amyclae’s god* is Apollo who had a shrine at Amyclae, near Sparta. *Bronze-housed Athena* is a reference to the shrine of Athena in Sparta. *Tyndareus’ splendid sons* are Castor and Pollux, the twin gods (brothers of Helen and Clytaemnestra). *The Eurotas* is a river near Sparta. The *thyrsus stalk* is a plant stem held by the followers of Bacchus in their ecstatic dancing. *Leda’s child* is Helen (wife of Menelaus, sister of Castor andPollux and Clytaemnestra, a child of Zeus).
