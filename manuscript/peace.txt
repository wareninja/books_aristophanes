**BACKGROUND NOTE**  

At the time *Peace* was produced in Athens, the city had been at war with Sparta for a number of years. However, peace negotiations had been going on, and it looked as if the two sides might just agree to end (or at least suspend) their hostilities.

*[Across the back of the flat open front of the stage, the Orchestra, are four structures: the farm house belonging to Trygaeus, a stable beside or in front of it, a cave whose opening is blocked in with rocks, and the palace of Zeus. Two ofTrygaeus’ slaves are in front of the stable. One is on his knees before a shallow tub preparing balls of dung taken from a pile in the yard, and the other is carrying these balls of dung into the stable]*  

  

FIRST SERVANT [coming from the stable door]  
 Come on, bring us a cake for the beetle.  
 Get a move on! Hurry up.  

SECOND SERVANT [on his knees kneading dung into cakes]  
 There you go.  
 Give him that. May it kill the wretched beast!  
 I hope he never swallows anything  
 more delicious than that ball of shit.  

[First servant takes the cake, goes into the stable, and returns]  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Give him another one. And make this cake  
 out of pounded donkey dung.  

SECOND SERVANT  
 Back again?  
 Where’s the one you took in there just now?  
 He can’t have eaten it.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Eaten it? By Zeus,  
 he grabbed it, rolled in round between his feet,  
 and then swallowed it—the whole damn thing.  
 Hurry up and pound out more, lots of them—  
 and pack them tight.  

[First Servant carries another cake into the stable and returns]  

SECOND SERVANT [looking at the audience]  
 You dung collectors out there, 
 in the name of the gods, give me a hand,  
 unless you want to see me choke.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Hand me another cake—  
 from a boy prostitute. He says he needs  
 something made from shit that’s been well pounded.  

SECOND SERVANT [tossing him a cake]  
 There you go.  

[First Servant returns to the stable. The Second Servant addresses the audience]  

 Gentlemen, there’s one thing  
 I think I’ll never be found guilty of.  
 No one will claim that as I pound this muck  
 I help myself and eat the stuff.[^note-601]  

FIRST SERVANT [holding his nose]  
 Good god!  
 Get me another, and then bring one more,  
 and then another. Keep packing more.  

SECOND SERVANT  
 No, by Apollo, not me! I can’t stand  
 this disgusting muck a moment longer!  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Then I’ll take the dung inside, tub and all.  

[The First Servant picks up the tub full of dung and carries it into the stable]  

SECOND SERVANT  
 To hell with it, by god, and you as well.  

[addressing the audience]  

 If any of you knows, please tell me now                                                                                              
  
 where I can get a nose without a nostril.  
 There’s no work that is more miserable   
  
 than rolling this stuff up and serving it  
 to feed a beetle. Now, a pig or dog,  
 as soon as someone’s had a shit, eats it  
 without a fuss. But this conceited brute,  
 like some lady, is so full of itself, 
 it won’t eat unless I mash the stuff all day 
 then serve it rolled into a ball by hand.  
 But I’ll take a look, see if it’s done eating.  
 I’ll open this door, but just a sliver,                                                                                                            
  
 so it won’t see me.  

[He pushes the stable door slightly and looks inside]  

 Go on—keep eating,  
 and don’t ever stop, not until you burst  
 all by yourself in there. That damned creature—  
 look how it eats, mashing with its molars, 
 moving its head and arms around like that,  
 like a wrestler or those who twist the cords  
 to make thick ropes for cargo ships.  

FIRST SERVANT [returning from the stable]  
 That brute—  
 smelly, foul and greedy! I’ve no idea  
 what god this stinking apparition comes from,  
 but I reckon it wasn’t Aphrodite                                                                                                                   
  
 or the Graces.[^note-602]  

SECOND SERVANT  
 Then who was it?                      

FIRST SERVANT  
 It’s got to be   
  
 some monstrosity sent down here from Zeus, 
 lord of the thundercrap.  

SECOND SERVANT  
 Well, some youngster  
 out there in the audience who thinks he’s smart  
 by this point will be saying, “What’s going on?  
 What does this beetle mean?” And an Ionian 
 sitting next to him is saying, “In my view,  
 it’s a reference to Cleon, showing how  
 he’s not ashamed to wolf down shit all day.”[^note-603]  

FIRST SERVANT [getting ready to urinate]  
 I’m going in to give the beast a drink.  

[First Servant goes back into the stable]  

SECOND SERVANT  
 Well then, I’ll explain what’s going on here   
               
  
 for children, youngsters, grown ups, and old men,  
 even for these self-important windbags.[^note-604]  
 My master’s got some new form of madness—  
 not your kind, but something really new.  
 All day long he gazes at the heavens  
 with his mouth open, like this, and cries out,  
 yelling up at god, “O Zeus,” he says,  
 “What on earth are you doing? What’s your plan?  
 Put that broom aside. Don’t sweep Greece away!”  
 Wait! Hold on! Quiet. I think I hear his voice.   
  

TRYGAEUS [from inside the house]  
 O Zeus, what will you do for our people?  
 You’ll be devastating all our cities  
 without any sense of what you’re doing.  

SECOND SERVANT  
 That’s it, the sickness I’ve been talking of.  
 There you hear a sample of his madness.  
 When this disturbance first came over him,  
 he’d keep saying to himself, “How can I  
 gain access to Zeus right now?” So he had  
 some slender ladders made for him, and then,  
 he’d try to climb them all the way to heaven,  
 until he’d tumble down and break his head.  
 Well then, damn him, he went out yesterday,  
 I don’t know where, and brought back a beetle,  
 a monstrous thing from Etna. He’s forced me  
 to be its groom, while he keeps stroking it,  
 as if it were a pony, and saying  
 “O my little Pegasus, my thoroughbred,  
 my flying steed, now you must carry me  
 directly up to Zeus.” I’ll have a look,  
 bend down here and see just what he’s doing.  

[The Second Servant stoops to look through a hole in the walls of the stable]  

 O this is dreadful! Come here, neighbours! Here!  
 My master’s rising up into the air,                                                                                                               
  
 riding astride the beetle like a horse!  

[Trygaeus appears on the giant dung beetle rising up into the air behind the stable]  

TRYGAEUS  
 Easy now, beetle, gently does it, easy.  
 Don’t charge and make things much too rough for me, 
 trusting your strength, right at the start of things,  
 not until you sweat, and your beating wings  
 loosen up your joints and make your muscles free.  
 I beg you, don’t breathe on me that filthy smell.  
 If you do that, you can stay here in your cell.  

SECOND SERVANT [calling up to Trygaeus]  
 Master, my lord, how crazy you’ve become!                                                                                       
  

TRYGAEUS [here and in following speeches declaiming in the grand style]  
 Be silent! Hold your tongue!  

SECOND SERVANT  
 Why are you  
 flapping through the air so senselessly?  

TRYGAEUS  
 I’m soaring off to help out all the Greeks,  
 a bold new venture, never done before.  

SECOND SERVANT  
 Why are you flying? Why this mad sickness?  

TRYGAEUS  
 You must speak fair words and never mutter  
 such trivial sounds. Instead cry out with joy.  
 Tell men to hold their tongues and to close in  
 their toilets and their sewers with fresh bricks   
              
  
 and to plug their arse holes firmly shut.  

SECOND SERVANT  
 There’s no way I’ll stay quiet, not unless  
 you tell me where you plan to fly.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Where else, 
 but up to Zeus in heaven?  

SECOND SERVANT  
 What for?  

TRYGAEUS  
 To ask him about each and every Greek—  
 what he’s got in store for them.  

SECOND SERVANT  
 And what if  
 he doesn’t tell you?  

TRYGAEUS  
 I’ll take him to court  
 for treason, selling Greeks out to the Medes.[^note-605]  

SECOND SERVANT  
 No, by Dionysus, you’ll never go,  
 not while I’m alive.  

TRYGAEUS  
 There’s no other way.  

SECOND SERVANT [shouting into the house]  
 Help! Help! Help! Children, your father’s leaving—                                                                    
  
 he’s secretly abandoning you all  
 to go to heaven.  

[Trygaeus’ two young daughters come out of the house]  

 You poor wretched girls,  
 try pleading with your father. Beg him.  

CHILD  
 Father, oh father, is this report true,  
 what those at home are saying about you—  
 you’re leaving me here, going up to the sky,  
 to the birds and the ravens? You’re trying to fly?[^note-606]  
 O daddy, these stories—are they all quite true?  
 If you love me, I need an answer from you.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Yes, my girls, it’s what you think. The truth is  
 I’ve had with you—you keep begging me  
 for bread and calling me your daddikins,                                                                                            
  
 when there’s not a drop of money in the house,  
 nothing at all. But when I’m successful,  
 when I get back again, you’ll soon enjoy  
 a huge cake with my knuckles for a sauce.[^note-607]  

DAUGHTER  
 But how are you going to finish the trip?  
 You can’t travel that road in a sailing ship.  

TRYGAEUS  
 A young horse with wings will be carrying me.   
  
 I won’t journey there in a ship on the sea. 

DAUGHTER  
 Daddy, how did you plan to capture this thing,  
 harness it, and go to the gods on the wing?  

TRYGAEUS  
 In those stories by Aesop, I found out  
 the beetle was the only beast with wings                                                                                              
  
 that could reach the place where gods reside.  

DAUGHTER  
 Father, father, that’s false. All folks deny  
 stories which say that stinking brutes fly  
 and can come to the gods way on high.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Once, long ago,  
 when it had a quarrel with an eagle,  
 it went up there and took out its revenge  
 by rolling from the nest the eagle’s eggs.  

DAUGHTER  
 You should have hitched Pegasus and his wings.  
 Then the gods would see you as those tragic kings.  

TRYGAEUS  
 My dear girl, I’d have needed twice the food.  
 But now whatever meal I eat myself  
 will serve to feed this beetle, too.  

DAUGHTER  
 But what if it falls in the depths out at sea?  
 With wings like those ones, how will it flee?  

TRYGAEUS [lifting up his phallus or exposing his penis]  
 For that I’ve got this rudder I can use.  
 And the beetle will be just like those boats  
 they make in Naxos.[^note-608]  

DAUGHTER  
 But then as you float,  
 what harbour will open up for that boat?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Doesn’t Piraeus have a Beetle Harbour?[^note-609]  

DAUGHTER  
 Beware of collisions. You might fall down  
 from way up there and become a lame clown.  
 If so, to Euripides you’d give a story,  
 and he’d turn you into some tragic glory.[^note-610]  

TRYGAEUS  
 I’ll watch out for that. And now good bye!  

[Trygaeus addresses the audience as he starts moving higher]  

 And you for whom I’m doing all this work,  
 for the next three days you mustn’t fart or crap.  
 If this creature smells that while in the air,  
 it’ll toss me head first and come down to graze.  
 So come now, Pegasus, be off. Good luck.  
 Keep those bright ears of yours pricked up  
 and shake that golden bridle and your bit  
 until they rattle. What are you doing?  
 What are you up to? Why turn your nose  
 toward those stinking sewers? Let yourself  
 go bravely up above the earth, stretch out   
  
 those racing wings of yours and head straight for  
 the halls of Zeus. Keep your nose out of the shit,  
 away from all the food you eat each day.  
 Hey, that man down there, what are you doing?  
 I mean that one crapping in Piraeus,  
 right by the whorehouse. You’re destroying me,  
 doing me in. Can’t you please bury the stuff,  
 pile lots of earth on top, and then plant thyme  
 and pour perfume on it? If I fell down  
 and something happened to me from up here   
  
 and killed me, the state of Chios would be fined                                                                          
  
 five talents, all because of your ass hole.[^note-611]  
 O my god, I’m scared. And I’m not joking,  
 not any more. You there working this machine,  
 take good care of me. Right now there’s a wind  
 twisting its way around my belly button.  
 If you don’t watch it, I’ll be making stuff  
 to feed the beetle. But it seems to me  
 I’m getting near the gods. Yes, I can see  
 the home of Zeus.  

[By this point the beetle has descended and come to rest in front of the house of Zeus.  
Trygaeus gets off the beetle and knocks on the door]]  

 Who’s in there, in Zeus’ house?   
  
 Why won’t you open up?  

HERMES [from inside]  
 A human voice!                                                                                                   
  
 Where did that come from?  

[Hermes opens the door and sees Trygaeus and the dung beetle]  

 Lord Hercules!  
 What’s that disgusting thing?  

TRYGAEUS  
 A horse beetle.  

HERMES  
 You disgusting, reckless, shameless creature!  
 You scoundrel, you consummate rascal,  
 the worse rogue there is! How did you get here,  
 you most villainous of all the villains!  
 Whats your name? Speak up, won’t you?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Super-scoundrel.  

HERMES  
 In what country were you born?  
 Tell me.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Super-scoundrel.  

HERMES  
 Who’s your father?  

TRYGAEUS  
 My father? Super-scoundrel.  

HERMES  
 By this earth,  
 you’ll die for sure if you don’t give your name.    

TRYGAEUS  
 I’m Trygaeus and I’m from Athmonum,[^note-612]  
 a good vine-grower. I don’t slander people,                                                                                      
  
 and I don’t like disputes.  

HERMES  
 Why have you come?  

TRYGAEUS [handing Hermes a steak]  
 To bring you this meat.  

HERMES [grabbing the meat and in a very different tone]  
 You poor fellow,  
 how did you get here?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Well, sticky fingers,  
 you see how you no longer think of me  
 as the vilest of all rogues. Please be off now  
 and summon Zeus for me.  

HERMES  
 Oh dear, dear, dear!   
  
 You won’t reach the gods. You’re not even close.  
 They’ve gone away. They moved out yesterday.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Where on earth they go?  

HERMES  
 They wouldn’t go to earth!  

TRYGAEUS 
 Well, then, where?  

HERMES  
 Oh, a long, long way away,  
 under the very dome of heaven itself.  

TRYGAEUS  
 So why have you been left here by yourself?                                                                                    
  

HERMES  
 I’m keeping an eye on the furniture,  
 what’s left of it—some little pots and pans,  
 boards, some wine jugs.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Why have the gods all left?  

HERMES  
 They’re angry at the Greeks—so they moved War   
  
 into the house where they used to live,  
 giving him full power to treat you Greeks  
 any way he wishes. They moved their home  
 even higher up, as far as they could go,  
 so they wouldn’t see you fighting any more  
 or hear any of your prayers.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Tell me this—  
 why have they been treating us like that?                                                                                            
  

HERMES  
 Because they tried to make peace many times,  
 but you prefer to fight. If the Spartans  
 had a small success, they’d say something like,   
  
 “By the twin gods, those Attic types will pay.”[^note-613]  
 And if, with events turning out quite well  
 for those in Attica, the Spartans came  
 to talk of peace, you’d answer right away,  
 “By Athena, they’re playing tricks with us.  
 No, by Zeus, there’s no way we’ll go along.  
 They’ll come back, if we hang on to Pylos.”[^note-614]  

TRYGAEUS  
 Yes, that’s way folks in our country talk.                                                                                              
  

HERMES  
 Well, that’s why I don’t think you’ll ever see  
 Peace in your time again.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Where’s she gone, then?   
  

HERMES  
 War has thrown her into a deep hole. 

TRYGAEUS  
 What hole?  

HERMES [pointing to the walled up cave in the central part of the stage]  
 That one, way down there. What’s more,  
 you see how many rocks he’s piled on top  
 to stop you hauling her back out again.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Tell me, what’s War planning to do to us?  

HERMES  
 All I know is last evening he brought home  
 a gigantic mortar.  

TRYGAEUS  
 He’s got a mortar?                                                                                                     
  
 What’s he going to do with that?  

HERMES  
 Well, he wants it  
 to pulverize the city states of Greece.  
 But I have to go. I think he’s coming out—   
  
 he’s making such a fuss in there.  

[Hermes leaves. The noise inside the house gets louder]  

TRYGAEUS [alarmed]  
 Oh, oh!  
 I’m in a mess. Come on, I’d better find  
 some way to get away from him. I think  
 I hear the sounds of a warlike mortar.  

[Trygaeus conceals himself. War enters, carrying a huge mortar and a basket of vegetables]  

WAR  
 Oh you human beings, you mortal men,  
 you human creatures who endure so much,  
 how your jaws are soon going to feel the pain!  

TRYGAEUS [from his hiding place]  
 By lord Apollo, look at the mortar,  
 the size of it! This is a disaster—  
 that look he’s got! Is this the enemy  
 we’re running from—so terrible, so tough,  
 so hard on a man’s legs?[^note-615]  

WAR [taking some leeks and putting them in the mortar]  
 O Prasiae!  
 thrice damned, five times damned, damned a thousandfold!  
 This very day you’re going to be demolished.[^note-616]  

TRYGAEUS  
 This is no concern of ours, gentlemen,  
 since it’s a problem for the Spartans.  

WAR [putting some garlic in the mortar]  
 Oh Megara, Megara, how very soon  
 you be crushed to bits, turned into mincemeat.[^note-617]  

TRYGAEUS  
 Whoa, my goodness me, he’s throwing in  
 some bitter tears for the Megarians,  
 big ones, too.  

WAR [grating some cheese into the mortar]  
 And Sicily, you’re destroyed, as well.  
 

TRYGAEUS  
 Such a great state to be grated down  
 in such a miserable way.  

WAR [pouring honey over the food]  
 All right, 
 lets pour over this some Attic honey.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Hey, I’d advise you use a different honey.  
 That stuff costs four obols. So ease up  
 with that stuff from Attica.  

WAR [calling for his servant]    
 Boy! Boy! Uproar!  

[Uproar enters from the house]  

UPROAR  
 Why’d you call me?  

WAR  
 I’ll make you really yelp!  
 Standing there doing nothing. Here’s a fist for you!  

[War punches Uproar in the face]  

UPROAR  
 That hurts! Oh master, I’m in agony!   
  
 Your fist wasn’t full of garlic, was it?  

WAR  
 Why don’t you run and fetch me a pestle?  

UPROAR  
 We don’t have one. It was only yesterday                                                                                           
  
 when we moved in here.  

WAR  
 Then go get one  
 from the Athenians—and make it fast.  

UPROAR  
 By god, I’ll do it. If I don’t find one,  
 then I’ll be beaten ‘til I howl.  

[Uproar runs off in a hurry]  

TRYGAEUS  
 Well now,  
 what are we poor wretched types to do?  
 You see there’s great danger threatening us.  
 If he returns and brings along a pestle,   
  
 War will sit there using it to pulverize  
 all our city states. O Dionysus, 
 may he perish and not get back with it!  

[Uproar comes running back empty handed]  

WAR  
 Here he is.  

UPROAR  
 What’s going on?  

WAR  
 You didn’t bring it?  

UPROAR  
 The strange thing is this—those Athenians  
 have lost their pestle, that tanner who ground                                                                               
  
 all Greece to powder.[^note-618]  

TRYGAEUS  
 By Athena,  
 that sovereign lady, he did well to die,  
 just when the city needed him to go,  
 before he dumped us all into that hash.   
  

WAR  
 Then go get another one in Sparta  
 and be quick about it.  

UPROAR  
 I’m off master.  

[Uproar moves off quickly. War shouts after him]  

WAR  
 And get back here on the double.  

TRYGAEUS [to the audience]  
 Well, men,  
 what’s going to happen to us? At this point,  
 we’re in deep trouble. So if one of you,  
 by chance, is an initiate of Samothrace,  
 this would be a splendid time for you to pray  
 the servant lad sprains both his feet.[^note-619]  

UPROAR [running back on stage and striking an exaggerated pose]  
 Alas!                                                                                  
  
 O woe is me! And one more time Alas! 

WAR  
 What is it? You mean this is the second time   
  
 you’ve come back without a pestle?  

UPROAR  
 Yes.  
 The Spartans have lost their pestle, too. 

WAR  
 How’d that happen, you rogue?  

UPROAR  
 Well, they lent it  
 to some other folks in Thracian country,  
 and it got lost.  

TRYGAEUS  
 By those two sons of Zeus,  
 the Thracians did good work! Good luck to them!  
 You mortal men, keep up your courage!  

WAR  
 Pick up this stuff and take it back inside.  
 I’m going in to make myself a pestle. 

[War leaves. Uproar collects the mortar and vegetables and follows after him. 
Trygaeus emerges from his hiding place]  

TRYGAEUS  
 All right, now it’s time to sing that old song   
  
 Datis used to sing every day at noon                                                                                                       
  
 when he’d yank his cock, “Ah, how that feels good!  
 O, that’s so nice! I’m getting off on this!”[^note-620]  
 You men of Greece, now’s an excellent time  
 to set aside our quarreling and fights  
 and drag up Peace, who’s friendly to us all,  
 before some other pestle interferes.  
 So you farm labourers and merchants,  
 you carpenters, craftsmen, immigrants,  
 foreigners, and islanders, come here,   
  
 all common folk, as quickly as you can,  
 and bring some picks and ropes and levers.  
 Now’s our chance to have a drink together,                                                                                      
  
 a swig from the Good Spirit’s cup.[^note-621]  

[The Chorus enters. It consists of working people from many different Greek states]  

LEADER OF THE CHORUS  
 Come on this way, all those of you who’re keen  
 to rescue us right now. It’s now or never!  
 All you Greeks, let’s help each other out  
 by getting rid of all our warlike ranks  
 and the nasty deep red colour of blood.  
 The day that Lamachus detests is here.[^note-622]     
  

[The Chorus Leader turns to address Trygaeus]  

 So come on, tell us what we need to do.  
 Give us some direction. It seems to me  
 there’s no way I’ll be stopping work today  
 until we’ve used these levers and machines  
 to haul out here into the light of day  
 the greatest goddess of them all, the one  
 who more than any other loves the vine. 

TRYGAEUS  
 You must keep quiet, just in case your joy  
 in what we’re doing and these shouts of yours  
 gets War, who’s in there, fired up again.   
             
  

CHORUS LEADER  
 But we’re so pleased to hear your proclamation—  
 it’s not like those which tell us to come out  
 with rations for three days.[^note-623]  

TRYGAEUS  
 Be careful now  
 in case Cerberus howls and yelps down there,  
 the way he did when he was here on earth,  
 and makes it hard for us to save the goddess.[^note-624]  

CHORUS LEADER  
 No one will take her back from us again,  
 if we can once lay hands on her.  

CHORUS  
 Hip hip hurrah!  

TRYGAEUS  
 You men, if you don’t stop those cheers of yours  
 you’ll be the death of me. War will charge out   
  
 and his two feet will stomp on everything. 

CHORUS LEADER  
 Well, let him make trouble and shake things up!                                                                         
  
 Let him walk over everything! Today,  
 we’re not going to stop our celebrations.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Why seek danger? Men, what’s got into you?  
 You’re dancing’s going to wreck a splendid plan!  

CHORUS LEADER  
 But I’m not the one who likes this dancing.  
 It’s my legs—they keep hopping on their own  
 from sheer delight. I’m not moving them.  

TRYGAEUS  
 But that’s enough now. Come on, stop dancing.   
  
 Stop it!  

CHORUS LEADER  
 All right. Look, I’ve stopped.  

[The Chorus Leader keeps on capering around, his legs out of control]  

TRYGAEUS  
 You say so,  
 but you haven’t stopped at all.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Well, let me  
 dance one more turn and then I’m done.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Just one,  
 and then you’ll have to stop—no more dancing.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 If it helps you, we won’t dance any more.                                                                                           
  

TRYGAEUS  
 But look, you still haven’t stopped!  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Yes, by Zeus,  
 I kick out my right leg like this—that’s it!  

TRYGAEUS  
 All right, I’ll let you get away with that,  
 if you don’t keep on trying to piss me off.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Well, I must have my left leg dance as well.  
 I’m rid of my shield—that makes me so glad,  
 I fart and laugh, more than if I’d shed old age.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Don’t rejoice right now. You don’t know for sure,  
 at least not yet. But when we’ve got the goddess,  
 then you can shout and laugh and celebrate.  
 At that point you can sail or stay at home                                                                                          
  
 or fuck or sleep, watch holy festivals,  
 play cottabos, or live like Sybarites,  
 and keep on yelling out “Hurray! Hurray!”[^note-625]  

CHORUS LEADER  
 How I wish to see that day at last!  
 I’ve endured a lot, even mattresses  
 allotted by the gods to Phormio.[^note-626]  
 You’ll no longer find me as a juryman  
 bitter and bad tempered, nor, I think,                                                                                                    
  
 harsh in my ways, as I was earlier.  
 Instead you’ll see a soft, much younger man,  
 once I’m free from troubles. For long enough  
 we’ve killed each other, wearing ourselves out  
 on journeys to the Lycaeum and back  
 with sword and shield.[^note-627]   But what can we do   
  
 to bring you most delight? Come on, speak up.  
 It’s happy circumstance that’s chosen you                                                                                           
  
 as our supreme commander.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Well, come on.  
 Let me see how we get these stones removed.  

[Enter Hermes]  

HERMES  
 You reckless rogue, what are you going to do?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Nothing bad—we’re just like Cillicon.[^note-628]  

HERMES  
 You evil wretch, you’re done for.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Yes, I am,  
 if that’s how my lot turns out—Hermes would know  
 how to do things with a lottery.[^note-629]  

HERMES  
 You’re doomed!  
 You’re dead!  

TRYGAEUS  
 On what day?  

HERMES  
 Immediately.   
  

TRYGAEUS  
 But I’ve not purchased any flour or cheese  
 for my forced march to death.[^note-630]  

HERMES  
 No doubt about it,  
 you’re already mincemeat.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Then why is it  
 receiving such a major benefit                                                                                                                        
  
 has escaped my notice?  

HERMES  
 Are you not aware  
 Zeus has issued a decree that anyone  
 who’s caught digging that goddess up must die?  

TRYGAEUS  
 You mean it’s absolutely necessary  
 I must perish on the spot?  

HERMES  
 Yes. Now you know.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Well then, lend me three drachmas right away,   
  
 so I can buy a sucking pig. Before I die,  
 I have to get myself initiated.[^note-631]  

HERMES  
 By Zeus, lord of thunder and lightning . . . 

TRYGAEUS [interrupting]  
 Master, I’m imploring you—by the gods—  
 don’t report us!  

HERMES  
 I cannot keep silent.  

TRYGAEUS  
 In the name of those meats I brought for you  
 from the goodness of my heart. 

HERMES  
 My dear chap,                                                                                    
  
 I’ll be destroyed by Zeus if I don’t shout  
 and make a real commotion over this.  

TRYGAEUS  
 No, don’t shout. O my dear little Hermes,   
  
 I’m begging you!  

[Trygaeus turns to address the Chorus]  

 You men, tell me  
 what you’re doing? You’re standing there like statues.  
 You fools, don’t hang around saying nothing,  
 if you do that, he’ll start to yell.  

CHORUS [chanting]  
 Lord Hermes, please don’t yell or squeal.  
 If you recall a tasty meal  
 of young pig as a gift from me,  
 don’t make my words a trivial plea.  

TRYGAEUS [joining the chant]  
 O lord and master, can’t you hear  
 how they are trying to bend your ear?   
  

CHORUS [chanting]  
 Do not reject the prayers we say                                                                                                                  
  
 and let us dig up Peace today.  
 Of all the gods you love men best  
 and give them gifts, so bless our quest,  
 if you dislike Pisander’s plume,  
 his spiteful pride, we will resume  
 our constant offerings to you,  
 my lord, with great processions, too.[^note-632]  

TRYGAEUS  
 Come, I beg you, have pity for their cries.                                                                                          
  
 They’re honouring you more than they used to do.   
  

HERMES  
 They’re greater robbers than they used to be.[^note-633]  

TRYGAEUS  
 What’s more, I’ll tell you of a terrible act,  
 a major plot against the gods, all of them.  

HERMES  
 All right, tell me. You might win me over.  

TRYGAEUS  
 For some time the Moon and that rascal Sun  
 have been hatching many plots against you,  
 to hand Greece over to barbarians.  

HERMES  
 Why would they do that?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Because, by Zeus,  
 we sacrifice to you—barbarians                                                                                                                    
  
 make their offerings to them. That’s why,   
  
 as one might expect, they want all of us  
 to be totally destroyed, so they alone  
 will have the rituals all to themselves.  

HERMES  
 So that’s why those two for some time now  
 have been stealing daylight on the sly  
 and taking bites out of each other’s disk,  
 those scoundrels![^note-634]  

TRYGAEUS  
 That’s right. So, dear Hermes,  
 put your heart into helping us find Peace,  
 and pull her out with us. We’ll celebrate  
 the great Panathenaea in your honour,   
  
 and festivals to all the other gods—  
 the Mysteries, Dipolia and Adonia                                                                                                             
  
 will honour Hermes.[^note-635]   The other cities,  
 once free of misery, will sacrifice  
 to Hermes as their guardian everywhere.  
 You’ll get fine things, a huge variety.  
 To start things off, I’ll give you this gift,  
 a bowl for you to pour libations with.  

[Trygaeus pulls a golden bowl from his pocket and gives it to Hermes]  

HERMES  
 My, my, how I’m always keen on presents  
 when they’re made of gold.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Come on then men,   
  
 get to work in there. Take those picks of yours,  
 move in, and get those stones removed. Hurry!  

CHORUS LEADER  
 We’ll do it. But you, wisest of the gods,  
 take charge of us. You understand this task,  
 so tell us what we need to do. You’ll find  
 we won’t be slack in doing other work.                                                                                                  
  

TRYGAEUS  
 Come on, hurry up and hold the bowl out,  
 so we can offer prayers up to the gods  
 before beginning work.  

HERMES  
 A libation!  
 A libation! Now speak the reverent words.   
  
 Speak well. As we pour out this libation,  
 let’s pray an age begins this very day  
 when many fine things come for all the Greeks,  
 and anyone who works with his whole heart  
 to pull the ropes won’t grip his shield again.[^note-636]  

TRYGAEUS  
 By Zeus, may we spend our lives in peace,                                                                                         
  
 embracing mistresses and poking fires.  

HERMES  
 And any man who’d rather be at war . . . 

TRYGAEUS [interrupting]  
 O lord Dionysus, may he never stop  
 yanking arrows from his funny bone.   
  

HERMES  
 If there’s a man eager for army rank  
 who does not wish to drag you to the light,  
 O lady, in his battles . . . 

TRYGAEUS [interrupting again]  
 May he go through  
 the same experience as Cleomenes.[^note-637]  

HERMES  
 And anyone who manufactures spears  
 or deals in shields and thus is keen for war  
 because of better trade . . . 

TRYGAEUS [interrupting]  
 Let such a man  
 be seized by thieves and get no food to eat  
 but barley.  

HERMES  
 If someone will not work with us                                                                         
  
 because he wants to be a general,  
 or if a slave is ready to desert . . . 

TRYGAEUS  
 May he be laid out on a wheel and whipped.  

HERMES  
 May good things come to us! Now raise a shout!  
 Strike up a cry of joy!  

TRYGAEUS  
 Leave out the strike.  
 Just shout out for joy.[^note-638]  

HERMES  
 Oh, all right, then.  
 Hail! Hail! That’s all I’ll say! Hail to Hermes,  
 the Graces and the Seasons, to Aphrodite  
 and Desire! What about Ares?  

CHORUS  
 No, no!  

TRYGAEUS  
 And no cheers for Enyalius, right?[^note-639]  

CHORUS  
 No! 

[The Chorus wrap the rope around something in the cavern and start to pull, 
but, as they make the effort, they get hopelessly confused, pulling in different 
directions and falling over each other]  

TRYGAEUS  
 All right, everyone make a real effort   
  
 and pull these ropes to reel her in.  

HERMES  
 Heave away!  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Heave ho!                                                                                                                                                                               
  

HERMES  
 Come on, pull!  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Pull even harder!  

HERMES  
 Heave . . . Come on, heave!  

TRYGAEUS  
 The men won’t pull together.  

[Trygaeus turns to one group of men]  

 Why not pull your weight? You’re too proud to work.  
 O you Boeotians, you’ll be crying soon.  

HERMES  
 All right now, heave.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Heave ho!  

CHORUS LEADER [to Hermes and Trygaeus]  
 You two there,  
 come on and pull as well.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Aren’t I pulling, too—                                                                               
  
 holding the rope and hauling furiously,  
 working really hard?  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Then how come this job  
 isn’t moving forward?  

TRYGAEUS [to one of the workmen]  
 Hey, Lamachus,   
  
 you’re a problem sitting there, in the way.  
 My good man, we don’t need your monster.[^note-640]  

HERMES  
 Well, these Argives haven’t been hauling long.  
 They laugh at other people’s suffering,  
 collecting pay and rations from both sides.[^note-641]  

TRYGAEUS  
 But Spartans, my dear chap, are pulling rope  
 like real men.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 But look—among that crowd 
 the only ones who’re keen to help are those  
 who’ve been chained up in jail. The arms makers                                                                      
  
 keep getting in their way.[^note-642]  

TRYGAEUS  
 The Megarians   
  
 aren’t making any effort.  

HERMES  
 Well, they’re pulling  
 and showing all their teeth, like puppy dogs.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Yes, by Zeus, because they’re dying of hunger.[^note-643]  
 Hey, you men, we’re not getting anywhere.  
 We must all work at this together.  
 So one more time.  

HERMES  
 Heave!  

TRYGAEUS  
 Heave away!  

HERMES  
 Heave!  

TRYGAEUS  
 By Zeus, pull!  

CHORUS LEADER  
 We’re shifting it a little.                                                                                             
  

TRYGAEUS  
 This is dreadful—some are pulling one way,  
 others in another. You Argives there,  
 you’re going to get a beating!  

HERMES  
 Come on, heave!   
  

TRYGAEUS  
 Pull!  

CHORUS LEADER  
 There’re people here with us who’re traitors.  

TRYGAEUS  
 But those of you who long for Peace keep pulling—  
 put your backs into it!  

CHORUS LEADER  
 But some men here  
 are interfering, getting in the way.  

HERMES  
 Oh, you Megarians, get the hell away!                                                                                                    
  
 The goddess hates you, for she remembers 
 you were the first to rub your garlic on her.[^note-644]  
 And you Athenians, I’m telling you  
 stop holding that position where you’re pulling  
 at the moment—you’re not doing anything   
  
 but fighting in the courts. If you really wish  
 to set the goddess free, then move on down,  
 shift yourselves towards the sea a little.[^note-645]  

CHORUS LEADER  
 All right, men, let the farmers grab the rope  
 all by themselves, with no one else.  

HERMES  
 Ah, you men, now things are going much better.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 He says we’re getting somewhere. Come on, then,                                                                    
  
 every man must pull with all he’s got!  

TRYGAEUS  
 Hey, the farmers are getting the job done,  
 all by themselves.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Come on, all of you.   
  
 Come on!  

HERMES  
 Now they’re working all together!  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Let’s not relax—keep pulling even harder!  

HERMES  
 Here it comes now!  

[Something starts to emerge being pulled from inside the cavern]  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Now heave! Everyone, heave! 
 Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave!  
 Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Everyone, heave!  

[The trolley emerges from the cavern. On it stands Peace with her two attendants 
Opora and Theoria in a tableau reminiscent of contestants in a beauty pageant]  

TRYGAEUS  
 O holy lady who provides us grapes,                                                                                                        
  
 where can I find words to speak to you,  
 the ten-thousand-gallon words to greet you?  
 I didn’t bring them when I came from home.  
 And I welcome you as well, Opora,  
 and Theoria, too. What a gorgeous face  
 you’ve got there, Theoria, and sweet breath!  
 So fragrant to my heart! It’s just lovely—  
 like perfume or freedom from conscription.  

HERMES  
 You mean she smells just like a soldier’s pack?  

TRYGAEUS  
 The hateful pack of such a hateful person  
 makes me puke—it stinks of onion belches.  
 She smells of harvest times and festivals,                                                                                             
  
 the Dionysia, flute music, tragic plays,  
 songs of Sophocles, thrushes, poetic scraps   
  
 penned by Euripides . . .[^note-646]  

HERMES [interrupting]  
 You’re in trouble now,  
 spreading lies like that about her. She hates  
 that poet who uses trivial phrases  
 from the law courts.  

TRYGAEUS [ignoring the interruption]  
                                       . . . ivy, cloths for straining wine, 
 bleating flocks, women’s bosoms when they run  
 out to the fields, a drunken serving girl, 
 a jug of wine when it’s been overturned,  
 and lots of other splendid things.  

HERMES  
 Come now,  
 look how the city states are reconciled.  
 They’re chatting with each other, laughing,   
              
  
 having a good time, though all of them  
 have wonderful black eyes with cups attached.[^note-647]  

TRYGAEUS  
 And let’s also take a look at faces  
 in the audience here, to see if we can guess  
 what each man’s trade is.  

HERMES  
 That’s a stupid idea.  

TRYGAEUS [pointing to someone in the audience]  
 Can’t you see that man who makes battle crests?  
 He’s tearing his hair.  

HERMES 
 There’s someone who makes hoes—  
 he’s just farted at that sword smith.  

TRYGAEUS  
 See that one,  
 the sickle maker who’s feeling so good,  
 he’s flipped his finger at the spear maker?   
  

HERMES  
 All right, tell these labourers it’s time to go.                                                                                      
  

TRYGAEUS  
 Listen up, folks. The peasants should be off,  
 taking their farming tools back to the fields  
 as soon as possible. But leave behind  
 your swords and spears and javelins. This place  
 has now been overrun with mellow Peace.  
 So all men should move out and back to work—  
 off to the fields, singing a song of joy!  

CHORUS LEADER [to Peace]  
 Ah, this day our workers have so yearned for  
 and just men, too! I see you and rejoice.   
  
 After such a long, long time, how I wish 
 to greet my vines. How my heart desires  
 to hold in my embrace those same fig trees 
 I planted in the days when I was young.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Now men, first of all let’s offer prayers                                                                                                 
  
 to the goddess who’s brought us our freedom  
 from battle crests and Gorgons. After that,  
 let’s head off home, back to our farms. But first,  
 let’s buy a nice little piece of pickled fish  
 to eat while in the fields.  

[The Chorus pick up their various tools and form a line, in preparation for leaving]  

HERMES  
 By Poseidon,   
  
 how fine their ranks look, compact and spirited,  
 just like a barley cake or a sumptuous feast.  

TRYGAEUS  
 By Zeus, that’s a splendid mattock he’s got there,  
 all set to go, and those three-pronged garden forks  
 are glistening in the sun. They could clear out  
 the rows between our vines so beautifully!  
 Now I’m keen to get back home myself,  
 into the fields, working with my pitch fork,  
 turning clods of earth after all this time.                                                                                               
  
 You men, remember that old way of life   
  
 Peace used to give us in our earlier days,  
 those figs pressed into cakes or freshly picked,  
 the myrtles and sweet new wine, the violets  
 beside the spring, the olives we so longed for.  
 For the sake of these speak to the goddess now.                                                                           
  

CHORUS  
 Welcome, dearest goddess, welcome!  
 How I rejoice now that you’ve come.  
 Overwhelmed with longing for you,  
 I kept hoping for a miracle,  
 to go back to my fields again.  
 O lady we’ve been yearning for,  
 you were the greatest benefit  
 to all of us who spend our lives  
 working on the land, for you alone                                                                                                            
  
 would help us out. In earlier days,  
 while you were in control, we had  
 so many sweet and lovely things  
 that cost us nothing. For farmers  
 you meant security and wheat.  
 Our vineyards and our young fig trees  
 and all the other plants we have  
 will smile with joy to welcome you.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 But how can she have stayed away from us  
 for all this time? Hermes, of all the gods  
 you’re the friendliest to us, so tell me.  

HERMES  
 O you wisest of all working farmers,  
 listen to my words, if you’d like to hear  
 how Peace first went astray. It all began  
 when that Phidias ran into trouble,  
 and Pericles, afraid he’d share his fate,   
  
 for he was frightened of your character  
 and your ferocious ways, fired up the town, 
 before he had to suffer anything  
 too drastic, throwing out a little spark,  
 the Megarian decree, and fanned it  
 into a conflict so intense, the smoke                                                                                                        
  
 drew tears from all the Greeks, not only here,  
 but in Sparta, too.[^note-648]   Well, once that started,  
 the first vineyards were compelled to crackle  
 and a pot, once hit, kicked out in anger   
  
 at another pot, and there was no one there  
 who could prevent it any more. And so,  
 Peace just disappeared.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Well, by Apollo,  
 no one ever told me that’s what happened.  
 I’d never heard how Peace could be hooked up  
 with Phidias.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 I hadn’t either,  
 not until just now. But if she’s his kin,  
 that’s why she’s beautiful. So many things  
 are kept concealed from us!  

HERMES  
 Well, after that,  
 the towns who were your subjects, once they saw   
  
 you were so enraged at one another                                                                                                        
  
 and your fangs were out, hatched all sorts of plans  
 against you, because they feared the tribute,  
 and then used their gold to bribe the Spartans,  
 the most important of them, and those men,  
 being greedy and treacherous with strangers,  
 tossed Peace out in a disgraceful manner  
 and held out for war.[^note-649]   This gained them profit,  
 but brought the workers to catastrophe.  
 Warships repeatedly went out from here   
 
 to get revenge—they devoured the fig trees,  
 which belonged to men who bore no blame.  

TRYGAEUS  
 No, that was justified—those men chopped down  
 one of my trees of dark grey figs, a bush  
 I’d planted and then nursed with my own hands.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Yes, by Zeus, that was truly well deserved!                                                                                          
  
 Those men destroyed a storage chest of mine.  
 They smashed it with a stone. And that box held  
 six bushels full of corn!  

HERMES  
 Then working men  
 came from their fields in droves and let themselves,   
 
 without their knowing it, be bought and sold, 
 just as the others were. Longing for figs,  
 they didn’t even have grape pits to eat,  
 and so they looked toward the demagogues.  
 These men, who clearly knew how displaced folk  
 were weak and short of food, with their forked cries  
 drove Peace out, though she came back in person  
 many times, moved by affection for the land.  
 Then they began to squeeze the rich fat types  
 among their allies, on the trumped-up charge   
            
  
 that they were followers of Brasidas.  
 And then you lot would tear the man apart,  
 like puppy-dogs. The city was all pale  
 and cowering in fear. It would snap up  
 every scrap of slander with great pleasure,  
 whatever anyone tossed out. Strangers, 
 who saw the blows come raining down on them,  
 stuffed mouths of the informers shut with gold.  
 So they grew rich, while, without your knowledge,  
 Greece might have been destroyed. This work was done   
 
 by that man who dealt in leather.[^note-650]  

TRYGAEUS  
 Stop, lord Hermes!  
 That’s enough! Don’t tell us any more.  
 Leave that man where he is, down in Hades.  
 He’s no longer one of us. No, he’s yours.                                                                                             
  
 He was a villain when he was alive,  
 a windbag who liked to slander people,  
 an agitator who stirred up trouble,  
 but when you mention all these things right now,  
 your slandering one of your own people.[^note-651]  

[Trygaeus moves to talk to Peace]  

 But, reverend goddess, why are you so quiet?   
 
 Talk to me.  

HERMES  
 She won’t speak to this audience.  
 All the suffering she’s had to undergo  
 has made her very angry at them.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Then let her say a few words just to you.                                                                                              
  

HERMES  
 My dearest lady, tell me what you think  
 about these people here. Come on now,  
 of all women you hate war the most.  

[Hermes put his ear close to Peace’s mouth to listen to her whisper to him] [^note-652]  

 Speak up. I’m listening. That’s what annoys you?  
 I understand.  

[Hermes turns to address the audience]  

 Listen, you people here.  
 This is what she blames you for. She says   
 
 after that fight in Pylos she came here,  
 of her own free will, bringing a basket  
 full of treaties to the city, but you lot  
 turned her down three times in your assembly.[^note-653]  

TRYGAEUS  
 We were wrong to do that. But forgive us—  
 back then our brains were crammed with leather.  

HERMES  
 Listen now to something she’s just asked me.                                                                                 
  
 Who was the man most hostile to her here,  
 and who was friendly, someone really keen  
 not to fight on?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Well, Cleonymus   
 
 was her greatest friend by far.  

HERMES  
 Cleonymus?  
 What sort of fellow was he in a fight?  

TRYGAEUS  
 The very bravest spirit, except for this—  
 he wasn’t the son of the man he claims  
 as his own father. When he’d march out  
 with the army, he wouldn’t hesitate  
 to throw away his weapons.  

[Hermes places his ear close to Peace’s mouth again]  

HERMES  
 One more thing  
 she’s just asked me: Who now governs you                                                                                        
  
 and rules the rocky Pynx?[^note-654]  

TRYGAEUS  
 That position  
 is now occupied by Hyperbolus.[^note-655]    

[Peace turns her head away in disgust]  

 What are you doing? Why turn your head aside?  

HERMES  
 She’s turning away from these people here  
 in anger that they’d choose to vote themselves  
 such a scoundrel as their leader. 

TRYGAEUS  
 Ah well,  
 we won’t be using him for very long.  
 At the moment people need a leader.  
 They feel naked, so, for the time being,  
 they’ve wrapped that man around them.  

[Hermes again places his ear close to Peace’s mouth]  

HERMES  
 She asks  
 how this choice will benefit the city.  

TRYGAEUS  
 We’ll become more politically shrewd.   
 

HERMES  
 How will you do that?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Because Hyperbolus  
 makes lamps. Before this, we decided things                                                                                   
  
 by groping in the dark. But now our plans  
 are made by lamplight.  

[Hermes again places his ear close to Peace’s mouth]  

HERMES  
 My, my, the things  
 she’s told me to find out from you!  

TRYGAEUS  
 What things?  

HERMES  
 All sorts of stuff, especially ancient things  
 she left behind so long ago. And first,  
 she wants to know how Sophocles is doing.  

TRYGAEUS  
 He’s well, but something quite astonishing  
 has happened to him.  

HERMES  
 And what is that?   
 

TRYGAEUS  
 He’s changed from Sophocles into Simonides.[^note-656]  

HERMES  
 Into Simonides? How so?  

TRYGAEUS  
 He’s old,  
 and he’s decrepit, but for a profit  
 he’d go out sailing on a wicker mat.[^note-657]  

HERMES  
 Really? Is wise Cratinus still living?[^note-658]                                                                                                           
  

TRYGAEUS  
 He died when the Spartans came marching in.  

HERMES  
 What went wrong with him?  

TRYGAEUS  
 What happened? He collapsed.  
 He couldn’t bear to see jars full of wine  
 being broken. How many other troubles  
 have gone on in the city! So, lady,  
 we’ll never ship you out again.  

HERMES  
 Come on then,  
 if that’s so, you should take Opora here  
 as wife. Live with her in the countryside,  
 and make yourselves some grapes.  

TRYGAEUS [to Opora]  
 My dearest love,  
 come over here and kiss me.  

[Trygaeus and Opora embrace. Trygaeus turns to Hermes]  

 Lord Hermes,                                                                                               
  
 do you think it would do me any harm  
 if, after such a long time with no sex,  
 I had some with Opora?  

HERMES  
 Not at all,   
 not if you take pennyroyal later.[^note-659]  
 But take Theoria and lead her off   
 
 to the council place, where she lived before.  
 Get a move on!  

TRYGAEUS  
 O that blessed council,  
 it gets Theoria. You’ll be slurping soup  
 in huge amounts over the next three days,  
 eating so much meat and boiled sausage! 
 And so, dear friend Hermes, a fond farewell!  

HERMES  
 And farewell to you, too, human mortal.  
 May you live happy, and remember me.  

[Trygaeus prepares to leave, but when he looks for his flying dung beetle, it’s nowhere 
to be seen. He starts calling it]  

TRYGAEUS  
 Time to go home, beetle, let’s fly off home.                                                                                      
  

HERMES  
 He’s not in there.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Then where’s he gone?   
 

HERMES  
 He’s harnessed to the chariot of Zeus  
 and bears the lightning bolt.[^note-660]  

TRYGAEUS  
 The poor thing!  
 Where will he find shit to eat in heaven?  

HERMES  
 He’ll feed on Ganymede’s ambrosia.[^note-661]  

TRYGAEUS  
 All right, but how do I get down?  

HERMES  
 It’s easy.  
 Don’t worry. Go this way past the goddess.  

TRYGAEUS  
 This way, girls, just follow me, and quickly.  
 There’s lots of people waiting there for you  
 with their erections ready.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Go on! Farewell!  

[Trygaeus, Opora, Theoria and Hermes leave the stage]  

 Meanwhile we should hand all this equipment   
 
 over to attendants—give it to them                                                                                                           
  
 to keep safely. There are many thieving types  
 who really like to hang around the stage  
 and look for things to steal. 

[The Chorus hands over its various farm implements to stage hands who come in to collect it]  

 Guard these bravely,  
 and let’s explain to these spectators here  
 the road our words will take, what’s on our minds.  

[The Chorus moves to address the audience directly]  

CHORUS  
 The judges here ought to thrash the comic poet  
 who steps onto the stage in front of these spectators  
 to praise himself in verse. But, daughter of Zeus,  
 if it’s all right to pay due honour to the man   
 
 who is the finest and best known comic writer,  
 then our producer claims he merits your great praise.  
 First, he’s was the only man who stopped his rivals  
 making constant fun of rags and fighting wars with lice,                                                     
  
 and the first to ridicule and banish from the stage  
 the Herculeses who were always making cakes  
 and going hungry. He also dismissed those slaves  
 who kept on running off, or deceiving someone,  
 or getting whipped. They were always led out crying,  
 so one of their fellow slaves could mock the bruises   
 
 and ask then: “O you poor miserable fellow,  
 what’s happened to your skin? Surely a huge army  
 of lashes from a whip has fallen down on you  
 and laid waste your back?” Yes, our poet has removed  
 such feeble trash, such commonplace tomfoolery,  
 and created a great art for us, by building up  
 high-towered homes from lovely words and thoughts and jokes                                 
  
 which are not trivial stuff. And he does not present  
 obscure private types or women in his dramas.  
 No, with the spirit of Hercules he attacks   
 
 the greatest targets, striding through the dreadful stink  
 of stripped-off leather hide and the grandiloquence  
 of those with hearts of mud.  

CHORUS LEADER  

 Of all the bouts I fought  
 the very first was with the fanged-tooth one himself,  
 whose eyes shot out most dreadful rays, like a Bitch Star.  
 Round him circled a hundred moaning flatterers,  
 who’d spit-lick his head. He had a thundering torrent  
 of a voice, and he smelled as nasty as a seal,  
 the unwashed balls of Lamia, and camels’ arse holes.[^note-662]  
 When I saw this monstrosity, I did not fear,   
 
 but kept fighting constant wars with him, holding out  
 on your behalf and for the islanders. And so,                                                                                  
  
 it’s only right that you remember me and show  
 your gratitude by paying me back. Before this point,  
 when I’ve had success, I didn’t lose my mind and roam  
 around the wrestling schools trying to seduce young lads.  
 No, I took my theatre gear and went off on my way.  
 I didn’t cause much pain and brought you great delight,  
 producing everything just how it ought to be.  

CHORUS  
 And for this reason men and boys   
 
 should side with me. And we advise  
 bald men to join with us and strive  
 for victory, since if I win,  
 at tables and at festivals                                                                                                                                        
  
 every man will say, “Here, take this  
 to that bald man, give this bald man  
 a sweet dessert, and don’t hold back  
 from a man whose forehead matches  
 our noble poet’s balding skull.”[^note-663]  

 O Muse, drive wars away and dance,   
 
 my friend, dance with us—celebrate  
 the weddings of the gods, the feasts  
 of mortal men, and festivals  
 of those who have been blessed, for these                                                                                          
  
 have from the start been your concern.  
 And if that Carcinus should come  
 begging you to join his children  
 in a dance, don’t listen to him  
 or move to help them with their play.[^note-664]  
 Think of them all as homebred quails,   
 
 dancing dwarves with long scraggy necks,  
 sliced-up lumps of dung, who put on                                                                                                       
  
 mere artifice. Their father claimed  
 that once a play he was to stage,  
 a work no one had thought he’d write,  
 was choked one evening by a weasel.[^note-665]  

 Such are the long-haired Muses’ songs  
 the clever poet ought to sing  
 before the public, when swallows                                                                                                                
  
 sitting in the leaves in springtime   
 
 let forth their song, and choruses  
 of Morsimus are not allowed,  
 nor any from Melanthius,  
 whose most ear-piercing voice I heard  
 once screaming out—it was that day  
 he and his brother put on stage  
 the tragic chorus. What a pair!  
 Gorgon epicures and Harpies,                                                                                                                         
  
 ravenously devouring roaches,  
 foul rogues chasing down old women   
 
 and wiping out whole schools of fish.  
 What more, their armpits stink like goats![^note-666]  
 O goddess Muse, please spit on them—  
 a huge, wide gob of phlegm—and then,  
 throughout the party, play with me. 

[Trygaeus, now back home, enters with Opora and Theoria]  

TRYGAEUS  
 That was tough, going straight up to the gods.  
 My legs are really aching. You people                                                                                                     
  
 were tiny from up there. When I peered down,  
 from heaven you looked like total scoundrels,  
 but from here you seem a great deal worse.   
 

[The First Servant comes from Trygaeus’ house]  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Master, you’ve come back?  

TRYGAEUS  
 That’s what I’ve been told.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 What’s happened to you?  

TRYGAEUS  
 My legs are hurting—  
 it was a long road to travel.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 So tell me now . . .         

TRYGAEUS 
 What?  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Did you see any other human,  
 besides yourself, wandering through the air.  

TRYGAEUS  
 No, except perhaps two or three spirits  
 of dithyrambic poets.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 What were they doing?                                                                                              
  

TRYGAEUS  
 Oh, fluttering about collecting preludes  
 as they drifted in the airy breezes.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 So it isn’t true when people tell us   
 
 once we’re dead, we’ll be stars up in the sky?  

TRYGAEUS  
 No, that’s really true.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Then who’s that star there?  

TRYGAEUS  
 That’s Ion of Chios, who once composed,  
 when he was here, a poem about the dawn.  
 As soon as he got there, they all called him  
 the Star of Dawn.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Who are those stars up there  
 that rush across and blaze out as they move?  

TRYGAEUS  
 They are wealthy stars who, after dinner,                                                                                            
  
 are making their way home, holding lanterns  
 with lights inside. But come on, hurry up   
 
 and take this girl. Conduct her to the house.  
 Clean the bath tub, and heat some water up.  
 Prepare the wedding bed for me and her.  
 When you’ve finished that, come back here again.  
 Meanwhile, I’ll give this one to the council.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Where’d you get these girls?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Where else? In heaven.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 I wouldn’t give three obols for the gods  
 if they keep bawdy houses, just like us.  

TRYGAEUS  
 No they don’t, but there are some up there                                                                                       
  
 who do live off the trade.  

FIRST SERVANT [to Opora]  
 Come on then, let’s go.   
 
 Tell me, should I give her something to eat?  

TRYGAEUS  
 No. She won’t want to eat any bread or cake.  
 She always had the habit of licking up  
 ambrosia with the gods in heaven.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Well, we’ll just have to see if we can find 
 something for her to lick down here.  

[First Servant exits with Opora into Trygaeus’ house]  

CHORUS  
 This old man, as far as we can see,  
 is now working things out happily.  

TRYGAEUS  
 What will you think when very soon  
 you see me as a bright bridegroom?   
 

CHORUS  
 An old man to envy I presume.                                                                                                                      
  
 Once more you’ll have your youthful bloom  
 and lie there drenched in sweet perfume.  

TRYGAEUS  
 I think you’re right. And in a bit  
 when I’m in bed and hold her tit?  

CHORUS  
 Happier than a top-spinning lad  
 who calls that Carcinus his dad.  

TRYGAEUS  
 I deserve it. Is that not true?  
 I, one man, on a beetle flew  
 and saved the Greeks, who free from harm   
 
 now sleep and fuck on every farm.  

[First Servant returns from the house]  

FIRST SERVANT  
 The girl has finished bathing, and her bum      
 looks splendid. There’s a flat cake ready.  
 And the sesame balls are being rolled up.[^note-667]  
 Everything’s prepared. All we need now                                                                                               
  
 is an erect cock.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Then let’s get going  
 and present Theoria to the Council.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 This girl here? Who is she?  

TRYGAEUS  
 What do you mean?  
 This is Theoria.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 What? The girl  
 we used to travel with to Brauron   

 and then get drunk and screw?[^note-668]  

TRYGAEUS  
 The very same.  
 I had a hard time getting her away.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Oh, master, look at the ass on her—  
 I’d wait four years for that!  

TRYGAEUS [to the audience]  
 Now, let’s see.  
 Is there an honest man among you lot?  
 Where is he? Who’ll take charge of this girl here  
 and guard her for the Council?  

[To the First Servant who has been fondling Theoria’s backside]  

 Hey you,  
 what are you doing? Drawing a chart?  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Me? Oh, I’m reserving a camping spot  
 to house my prick in the Isthmian Games.[^note-669]     
            
  

TRYGAEUS [to the audience]  
 Tell me the man who’ll look after her.  

[To Theoria]  

 Come here. I’m going to take you down there  
 and put you in the middle of them.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Look there—  
 someone’s nodding his head!  

TRYGAEUS  
 Who is it?  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Who is it? It’s Ariphrades urging you  
 to take her over to him.  

TRYGAEUS  
 No, he’ll jump her  
 and start slurping in her lap. 

[To Theoria]  

 Come now,  
 to start with you can take that clothing off.  

[Theoria undresses and stands nude in front of the audience. Trygaeus takes her to up close to the spectators] [^note-670]  

TRYGAEUS  
 You council members and public officers,  
 look on this Theoria and witness   
 
 the splendid things I bring and give to you.  
 You can quickly raise these two legs of hers  
 high in the air and roast your sacrifice.                                                                                                 
  
 Look at the oven she’s got. 

FIRST SERVANT [peering at Theoria’s public hair]  
 Magnificent! 
 Smoky black down here because the Council  
 used to cook their meat in her before the war.  

TRYGAEUS  
 And now she’s yours. At first light tomorrow  
 you can arrange some really splendid games—  
 wrestling on the ground, mounting doggy style,  
 lying her on her side, or on her knees,   
 
 bending over, or rubbing on the oil  
 and grappling in a youthful free-for-all,  
 gouging and striking with your fists and prick. 
 Next day you’ll organize equestrian games,                                                                                      
  
 where riders straddle riders, chariots crash  
 on top of one another, and blow and pant  
 as they go at it. Then other riders  
 will be lying there with cocks all scraped  
 from falling out while moving round the turns.  
 So come on, you officials of the state,   
 
 accept Theoria.  

[Theoria moves down to the first row of spectators]  

 Look how eagerly  
 that public officer’s receiving her!  

[Addressing the public official Theoria is now giving him a lap dance]  

 That’s a motion you’d never introduce  
 if you weren’t going to get a big pay off.  
 No. I’d have found you reaching for a peace.[^note-671]   

CHORUS  
 A useful man brings the state bliss                                                                                                              
  
 And that’s the kind of man this is.  

TRYGAEUS  
 When you go gather in your grape  
 you’ll see I’m in much better shape.  

CHORUS  
 But now it’s clear what you’ve become.   
 
 You’ve saved mankind—that’s everyone. 

TRYGAEUS  
 Once you’ve chugged down some new-made wine,  
 a goblet full, you’ll say I’m fine.  

CHORUS  
 And we will constantly attest  
 but for the gods you are the best.  

TRYGAEUS  
 I’m Trygaeus from Athmonum.  
 and you owe me a tidy sum.  
 I’ve pushed away harsh misery.                                                                                                                      
  
 Now farm and working folk are free.  
 I’ve made Hyperbolus succumb.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 All right, what do we have to do next?  

TRYGAEUS  
 What else but to install the goddess Peace  
 by offering up some earthen pots?  

FIRST SERVANT  
 With pots?  
 Just like a grumpy little Hermes?[^note-672]   

TRYGAEUS  
 What do you think we should offer her?  
 A fattened bull?  

FIRST SERVANT  
 An ox? No not that.  
 We don’t need to serve as ox-iliaries.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Then what about a big fat porker?  

FIRST SERVANT  
 No, no.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Why not?  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Because we might turn into swine,  
 just like Theagenes.[^note-673]   

TRYGAEUS  
 Well what do you think?   
 
 What other animal?  

FIRST SERVANT  
 What about this,  
 a bummer lamb?  

TRYGAEUS  
 A bummer?  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Yes, by god.  

TRYGAEUS  
 But that’s a slang expression.[^note-674]                                                                                                                                         
  

FIRST SERVANT  
 That’s deliberate—  
 so when anyone in the assembly  
 says we must have war, those sitting there  
 can all cry out in fear, “War’s a bummer!”  

TRYGAEUS  
 That’s a fine idea!  

FIRST SERVANT  
 And in other things  
 we’ll be like gentle lambs, being very kind  
 to one another and a whole lot milder  
 to our allies.  

TRYGAEUS  
 All right, now get cracking.   
 
 Find that sheep and bring it here. I’ll prepare  
 an altar so we’ll have a sacrifice.  

[First Servant leaves]  

CHORUS  
 How everything the gods desire  
 and fortune turns into a favour  
 moves on to what we all intend.                                                                                                                   
  
 One by one, the good things come,  
 with luck all things work in the end.  

TRYGAEUS [pointing to a structure on the raised stage]  
 That makes good sense. Here’s our outside altar.  

[Trygaeus goes into his house and reappears with a basket during the Chorus’ next speech]  

CHORUS  
 Hurry while the stiff winds pause.  
 The gods have shifted them from war.   
 
 The spirits clearly want a change  
 to something better than before. 

TRYGAEUS [returning from the house]  
 Here’s the basket with barley seed, ribbons,  
 and a knife. We’ve got fire as well. So now,  
 the only thing we’re missing is the sheep.  

CHORUS  
 You’d better get a move on then—                                                                                                             
  
 If Chaeris sees you, he’ll show up  
 although you’ve not invited him.  
 He’ll have his flute with him, as well,  
 and tootle it for all he’s worth.  
 You’ll have to offer him a gift.[^note-675]   

[First Servant returns with a sheep. Trygaeus brings out some water in a basin]  

TRYGAEUS [to the First Servant]  
 Come on then, you can take the basket  
 and this water for our hands. Circle round  
 the altar quickly, moving to the right.  

FIRST SERVANT [following the instructions]  
 Watch, then. Now I’ve made my way around it.  
 You can tell me something else.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Hang on.  
 I’ll pick up this piece of burning wood  
 and plunge it in the water.  

[Trygaeus takes the stick out of the water and shakes drops of water on the altar and on 
the sheep. He then speaks directly to the sheep]  

 Nod your head.                                                                                    
  

[The sheep does nothing]  

 Hurry up!  

[The sheep eventually nods its head. Trygaeus addresses the First Servant]  

 Give me barley grains.           

[The First Servant hands the basket to Trygaeus, who takes some barley grains 
out of it and sprinkles them on the altar and on the sheep]  

 Now that basin—  
 wash your hands and then give it to me.   
 

[The First Servant and Trygaeus wash their hands in the water in the basin]  

 Now throw some barley in the audience.  

[The First Servant tosses some barley grains out over the spectators]  

FIRST SERVANT  
 There, that’s done!  

TRYGAEUS  
 You’ve thrown them out already?  

SERVANT  
 Yes, by Hermes. There’re no spectators here  
 who didn’t get some seed.  

TRYGAEUS  
 But none of it  
 was taken by the women.[^note-676]  

FIRST SERVANT  
 No. Their men  
 will fill them full of seed once evening comes.  

TRYGAEUS  
 All right. Then let us pray.  

[Trygaeus holds up the bowl of water and calls out to start the ritual]  

 Who is present here?  
 Where might their be many righteous men?  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Come on, give me the bowl. There’s lots of them,  
 and they’re all stout fellows.  

[The First Servant takes the bowl and throws the water over the Chorus.  
The members of the Chorus back away trying to avoid getting wet]  

TRYGAEUS  
 You really think so?   
            
  
 These are righteous men?  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Yes, they are. We soaked them  
 with that ritual water, and they’ve come back.  
 They stood their ground.      

TRYGAEUS  
 All right, let’s pray right away.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Yes, let us pray.  

TRYGAEUS  
 O most holy goddess, sacred Peace,  
 queen who rules our choral dancing,  
 queen of wedding celebrations,  
 receive our offerings to you.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Yes, most honoured lady, receive it,  
 Yes, by Zeus, and don’t act like wives   
 
 who like to sleep around, those women                                                                                                
  
 who open up the door a crack, peep out,  
 and then, if anyone starts eyeing them,  
 pull back again—but if he goes away,  
 they start looking out once more.  
 Don’t be like that with us again.  

TRYGAEUS  
 No, by god, but like a noble woman  
 reveal yourself completely to us,  
 who love you and for thirteen years now                                                                                             
  
 have been longing for you. Dissolve our fights,   
 
 our noisy quarrels, so we can call you  
 our Lysimache.[^note-677]   And bring to an end  
 our subtle suspiciousness, which leads us on  
 to babble nonsense to each other.  
 Bring us Greeks together once again,  
 a new start with the juice of friendship,  
 soothe our minds with a kinder tolerance,  
 and let fine goods fill up our market place—  
 huge garlics, early cucumbers, apples,                                                                                                     
  
 pomegranates, and for our servants cloaks,   
 
 but tiny ones. May we see men bringing  
 geese, ducks, and pigeons from Boeotia,  
 larks, as well, and may baskets full of eels  
 arrive from lake Copais. Let all of us  
 go out to buy them in a common crowd  
 and jostle with Morychus and Teleas  
 and Glaucetes and many other gluttons.  
 Let Malanthius come to market last,                                                           
  
 so they’re sold out and he begins to wail  
 and then to sing a song from his Medea,   
 
 “I am dying, done for, now I am bereft  
 the ladies lying hiding in the beets.”[^note-678]  
 And may men find all that delightful.  
 Grant these our prayers, most honoured goddess.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Take the knife and like a true master cook  
 butcher the sheep.  

TRYGAEUS  
 No. That’s not right.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Why not?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Peace surely gets no joy from slaughter.  
 Nor should one spill blood across her altar.                                                                                       
  
 Go, take the beast inside and sacrifice it.  
 Then cut the thigh bones out and bring them here.   
 
 That way we’ll save the sheep for our producer.  

[The First Servant takes the knife and leads the sheep back into the house]  

CHORUS  
 But here outside you’d better stop,  
 and quickly set the wood you chop,  
 and then all else you need on top.  

TRYGAEUS [arranging kindling for a small fire on the altar]  
 Well, don’t you think I’m setting up the wood  
 like a real diviner.  

CHORUS  
 You are indeed.  
 Does anything a clever man should know  
 escape you? What is there that you don’t know  
 which a man esteemed for his wise mind                                                                                             
  
 and for his daring ought to know?                                                

TRYGAEUS  
 There we are!   
 
 The wood’s alight. Stilbides will be upset.[^note-679]  
 I’ll go fetch a table. I don’t need the lad  

[Trygaeus goes inside the house]  

CHORUS  
 Who would not praise a man like that  
 who’s put up with so much danger  
 and has saved our sacred city?  
 Surely you’ll remain the envy  
 of people for all time to come.  

[Trygaeus and the First Servant return with a table and the things needed 
for the sacrifice, including various parts of the sacrificial sheep]  

FIRST SERVANT  
 All right, it’s ready. You take the thigh bones  
 and set them out. I’ll go for the entrails                                                                                                  
  
 and the offering of food.  

[First Servant goes into the house]  

TRYGAEUS  
 I’ll take care of it.   


[Trygaeus sets out the thigh bones on the altar, then calls after the First Servant]  

 You need to be here!  

[First Servant returns from the house carrying the entrails and some cakes as offerings]  
       
FIRST SERVANT  
 All right, here I am.  
 You don’t think I’m wasting time, do you?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Now make sure these things are properly cooked.  

[Trygaeus looks to the side and sees someone coming]  

 Someone’s coming here wearing a garland.  
 It’s made of laurel. Who the hell is he?  

FIRST SERVANT [looking in the same direction]  
 The man looks like a total charlatan.  
 He must be a diviner.  

TRYGAEUS  
 No, by god.  
 It must be Hierocles from Oreus,  
 the one who peddles oracles.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 All right.  
 What’s he going to say?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Well, it’s clear enough   
 
 he’s going to oppose the peace agreement.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 No, it’s the smell of sacrificial meat                                                                                                           
  
 that’s brought him here.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Then let’s pretend  
 we don’t see him.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 That’s all right with me.  

[Hierocles enters]  

HIEROCLES  
 What’s this sacrifice? To which one of the gods?  

TRYGAEUS [to the First Servant]  
 Keep quiet while your cooking and don’t touch  
 those parts of the rump.  

HIEROCLES  
 Aren’t you going to say  
 who this sacrifice is for?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Ah, that’s good—  
 the tail is roasting well.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Yes, a good omen.  
 O dear friend, lady Peace!  

HIEROCLES  
 Come on now,   
 
 start the offerings and give me the first piece.  

TRYGAEUS  
 It’s better to do the roasting first.  

HIEROCLES [peering at the cooking meat]  
 But these are cooked already.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Whoever you are,  
 you’re too much in the way.  

[to the First Servant]  

 Slice them up.  

FIRST SERVANT  
 Where’s the table?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Bring out the libations.  

[The First Servant goes into the house]  

HIEROCLES  
 The tongue is cut all by itself.                                                                                                                           
  

TRYGAEUS  
 We know.  
 You know what you should do?  

HIEROCLES  
 Yes, if you tell me.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Don’t say a word to us. We’re offering  
 a holy sacrifice to Peace.  

HIEROCLES [in the grand style]  
 O you miserable foolish mortal men!   
 

TRYGAEUS [interrupting]  
 It’s your head you’re talking about!  

HIEROCLES [continuing as before]  
 You who are so ignorant, you don’t know  
 what gods think, you’ve come to an agreement,  
 you who are men, with fierce-eyed monkeys.  

TRYGAEUS [laughing]  
 Ha, ha, ha!  

HIEROCLES  
 Why are you laughing?  

TRYGAEUS  
 I liked that—  
 fierce-eyed monkeys!  

HIEROCLES [continuing in the grand style]  
 Like timid idiots you place your trust in foxes,  
 who’ve got deceitful minds, treacherous hearts.  

TRYGAEUS  
 You rascal, I wish your lungs were as hot  
 as what’s cooking here.  

HIEROCLES  
 If those holy nymphs                                                                                      
  
 had not swindled Bacis and Bacis then   
 
 had not misled mankind, and if those nymphs  
 had not tricked Bacis one more time . . .[^note-680]  

TRYGAEUS  
 Damn you!  
 May you be utterly wiped out if you  
 don’t stop prattling on about that Bacis.  

HIEROCLES [continuing as before]  
 For it has not yet been decreed by Fate  
 that bonds of Peace should e’er be loosed  
 until such time as first of all . . . 

TRYGAEUS  
 This food here  
 be dusted with this salt.  

HIEROCLES  
 The blessed gods  
 will not be pleased that warfare terminate,  
 until the wolf is wedded to the sheep.   
 

TRYGAEUS  
 Damn you, how could a wolf ever get married  
 to a sheep?  

HIEROCLES  
 As long as the wood bug,  
 when it flies, emits the foulest smelling farts,  
 as long as the noisy polecat bitch still strives  
 to deliver her blind litter, that’s how long  
 it is not right for peace to have been made.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Then what should we have done? Not stop the war?                                                                
  
 Or decide by lot which of the two groups  
 should howl the loudest, when there’s a chance  
 for peace and we can then rule Greece together?   
 

HIEROCLES  
 You will never make the crab walk straight.  

TRYGAEUS  
 In future you will never eat again  
 at the Prytaneum or offer up  
 poetic fictions after the event.[^note-681]  

HIEROCLES  
 You will never smooth the prickly hedgehog.  

TRYGAEUS  
 You’ve been deceiving the Athenians—  
 will there ever come a day when you will stop?  

HIEROCLES  
 What sort of oracle commanded you  
 to burn these thigh parts to the deities?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Well, of course, it was the work of Homer,   
           
  
 that splendid oracle: “They pushed aside  
 the hateful cloud of war and then chose Peace,  
 installing her with beasts for sacrifice.  
 Once they’d cooked the thighs and tasted entrails,  
 they poured libations from a cup”—I led the way,  
 but no one gave a gleaming cup of wine  
 to the man who peddled oracles.  

HIEROCLES  
 I’ll have no part of that. It’s not a utterance  
 delivered by the Sibyl.[^note-682]  

TRYGAEUS  
 But, by god, 
 wise Homer does say something pertinent:   
 
 “The man in love with dreadful civil war  
 has no community, no rights, no home.”  

HIEROCLES  
 Be on your guard lest somehow a raptor bird                                                                                  
  
 seizes your wits, deceives you by a trick.  

TRYGAEUS [to the First Servant as he comes out of the house]  
 You, watch out for that bird—this oracle  
 is threatening our meat. Make a libation  
 and pass the entrails over here to me.  

[The First Servant makes a libation and serves Trygaeus some of the meat]  

HIEROCLES  
 If it’s all right with you, I’ll help myself.  

[Hierocles approaches the table with the offering on it]  

TRYGAEUS  
 Libation! Libation!  

HIEROCLES  
 Pour out some for me.  
 Present me with a portion of the meat.   
 

TRYGAEUS  
 But that’s not pleasing to the blessed gods.  
 Not before this happens—we pour a drink  
 and you get out of here. O lady Peace,  
 remain with us for all our lives.  

HIEROCLES  
 Serve me the tongue.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Why don’t you get your tongue away from here.  

HIEROCLES [grabbing some of the wine]  
 Libation!  

TRYGAEUS [hitting Hierocles]  
 Take this with your libation—                                                                                                    
  
 and hurry up.  

HIEROCLES  
 Will no one offer me  
 the entrails?  

TRYGAEUS  
 That’s not possible for us.  
 We can’t give you any, not until the wolf  
 gets married to the sheep.  

HIEROCLES  
 I’m begging you, 
 by your own knees . . .                  

TRYGAEUS [imitating Hierocles’ earlier style]  
 A futile supplication.   
 
 You’ll never make the prickly hedgehog smooth.  

[to the audience]  

 Come on, you spectators, come here and share  
 these entrails with us.  

HIEROCLES  
 What’s for me?  

TRYGAEUS  
 You? You can eat your Sibyl.  

HIEROCLES  
 No, by Earth  
 you two aren’t going to eat that up alone.  
 I’ll grab it from you. It’s public property.  

[Hierocles tries to steal some meat, but Trygaeus stops him and starts hitting him]  

TRYGAEUS  
 Hit him! Hit this Bacis!  

[The First Servant starts hitting Hierocles with a stick]  

HIEROCLES  
 I call as witnesses . . .  

TRYGAEUS  
 And so do I—that you’re a greedy fraud!                                                                                              
  
 Keep on hitting him with that stick of yours—  
 the imposter!  

FIRST SERVANT [giving Trygaeus the stick]  
 You do it. I’ll strip him   
 
 of those skins he stole from us by lying.  
 Come on, soothsayer, let go of those skins!  
 Do you hear me!  

[Hierocles runs off in terror of a beating]  

 What a fine crow he is  
 that’s flown in from Oreus! Why not fly  
 quickly on your journey to Elymnium![^note-683]  

[Trygaeus and the First Servant go into the house]  

CHORUS  
 I’m full of joy, yes, full of joy,  
 free from helmets, free from cheese,  
 and free from onions, too.  
 I don’t find battles any fun—                                                                                                                           
  
 not like the good parties with my friends   
 
 and steady drinking round the fire,  
 blazing wood from well-dried logs  
 cut up in summer time,  
 cooking chick peas, roasting acorns,  
 giving our Thracian girl a kiss,  
 while the wife is in her bath.  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Nothing’s more pleasant, once the sowing done,                                                                         
  
 than for god to send soft rain drizzling down  
 and for a friend to say, “Since it’s like this,  
 Comarchides, tell me what we should do.”   
 
 “Well, since the god is treating us so well,  
 I’d like to be drinking. So come on, wife,  
 warm up three measures of those chick peas,  
 mix in some wheat with them, and give us figs.  
 Get Sura to call Manes from the fields.  
 Today it’s totally impossible 
 to prune the vines or shovel up the mud.  
 The ground is soaked right through. Get someone  
 to fetch the thrush for me and those two finches.  
 And there was fresh birth milk in the house   
           
  
 and four bits of hare, unless the weasel 
 got off with some of them last evening.  
 I don’t know what was making all that noise  
 and rattling round in there. And so, my boy,  
 serve us up three of them and then take one  
 and give it to my father. And then ask  
 Aeschinades for some myrtle branches,  
 ones with berries, and since it’s on the way  
 someone should invite Charinades.  

 So he can come and drink with us   
 
 to god who’s giving so much help  
 assisting with our crops.  

 As soon as the cicada sings  
 his own sweet song, I love to see                                                                                                                  
  
 if those Lemnian vines of mine  
 are ripe already, their nature  
 makes them the very first to bloom  
 and to look at the swelling figs,  
 which, when they’re ripe, I love to eat  
 and keep on eating while I say   
 
 “I do love these seasons.” And then  
 I crush some thyme and stir a drink.  
 Yes, I get fat in summer time.                                                                                                                          
  

CHORUS LEADER  
 Much fatter than if I were looking at  
 some god damned military officer  
 with three helmet plumes and a crimson cloak,  
 dazzling red, which he claims is real dye  
 from Sardis. But if he ever has to fight  
 in his red cloak, then he himself gets dyed 
 the real Cyzicene yellow. He’s the first   
 
 to run away, shaking those plumes of his  
 just like a brown and yellow horse-cock,[^note-684]  
 while I stand just like someone watching  
 a hunting net. And then when they get home,  
 they act in an intolerable way.  
 On the conscription list they scribble down                                                                                      
  
 some of our names and scratch out others,  
 back and forth two or three times at random.  
 Tomorrow is set as the departure date,  
 and this man’s purchased no provisions.   
 
 He had no idea he was moving out.  
 Then he stops in front of Pandion’s statue,  
 sees his name, and rushes off in distress,  
 with a bitter glare at his misfortune.[^note-685]  
 They do these things to us country people,  
 less so to city folk, these very ones  
 who before god and men threw away  
 their shields. And if the gods are willing,  
 I’ll still call them to account for it.  

CHORUS  
 They’ve injured me with many slights.   
 
 Those men act at home are lions,  
 but foxes when it comes to fights.                                                                                                                
  

[Trygaeus and the First Servant emerge from the house]  

TRYGAEUS [handing the First Servant a plumed helmet]  
 Oh, oh! What a crowd we’ve got coming here  
 for the wedding dinner. Come on, dust off  
 the tables with this thing. There’s nothing else  
 it’s good for any more. And then pile up  
 the cakes, the thrushes, plenty of the hare,  
 and the bread rolls.  

[The First Servant goes into the house. Enter the Sickle Maker and a Potter.  
One is carrying sickles, another a basket of food.]  

SICKLE MAKER  
 Where’s Trygaeus? Where is he?  

TRYGAEUS  
 I’m cooking thrushes.  

SICKLE MAKER  
 O dearest Trygaeus,  
 you’ve done us so much good by making Peace!   
 
 Before now no one would’ve paid an obol                                                                                          
  
 for a sickle and now I’m selling them  
 for fifty drachmas. And this fellow here  
 flogs jars for three drachmas in the country.  
 So Trygaeus take some of these sickles  
 and these jars—take as many as you’d like,  
 free of charge. And please accept these presents.  
 We’re bringing you these gifts for your wedding  
 from what we’ve sold, the profits we have made.  

TRYGAEUS  
 All right. Put them over here beside me,   
 
 and go inside as quickly as you can to eat—  
 there’s an arms dealer coming and he looks  
 as if he’s really angry.  

[Enter an Arms Dealer, carrying a load of his goods, with an Armourer, a Trumpet  
Dealer, a Spear Maker, and a Helmet Maker, each carrying a lot of samples of his trade]  

ARMS DEALER  
 Damn it, Trygaeus,                                                                                                       
  
 you’ve completely ruined me!  

TRYGAEUS  
 You poor man,  
 what’s the matter? Are you crestfallen? 

ARMS DEALER  
 You’ve wiped out my trade, my livelihood,  
 and this man’s and this spear maker’s, too. 

TRYGAEUS  
 Well then, what should I pay for these two crests?  

ARMS DEALER  
 What are you offering?  

TRYGAEUS  
 What’s my offer?  
 I’m ashamed to say. Still, a lot of work   
 
 has gone into this attachment bracket,  
 so I might offer for the two of them  
 three measures of dried figs. I can use them  
 for dusting off the table.  

ARMS DEALER  
 All right, done.  
 Now go and bring the figs.  

[Trygaeus takes the helmet crests and goes into the house.  
The Arms Dealers talks to his companion]  

 Well, it’s better                                                                                        
  
 than getting nothing.             

[Trygaeus re-emerges with the helmet crests, which he throws at the Arms Dealer]  

 Get these out of here!  
 Take them from my house! To hell with them!  
 These aren’t helmet crests. They’re shedding hair!  
 I wouldn’t pay a single fig for them.  

ARMOURER  
 What’s a poor fellow like me going to do   
 
 with this splendidly made curved breastplate?  
 It’s worth ten minas.  

TRYGAEUS [taking the breastplate]  
 With this one here  
 you won’t lose money. Let me purchase it  
 for cost price. It’ll be really useful  
 when I need to shit . . . 

[Trygaeus puts the armour on the ground and starts pulling up his clothes,  
as if he is going to crap in the metal]  

ARMOURER  
 Stop insulting me  
 and my merchandise.                                             

TRYGAEUS  
 Like this, but it needs                                                                
  
 three stones placed beside it.[^note-686]  

[He sits on the armour]  

 Hey, it works.  

ARMOURER  
 How will you wipe yourself, you idiot?  

TRYGAEUS [picking up stones and reaching through the arm holes on the metal]  
 One hand goes through this hole, the other one . . .  

ARMOURER  
 You wipe yourself with both hands at once?   
 

TRYGAEUS  
 Yes, by god, so I don’t get arrested  
 for concealing an oar hole on the ship.[^note-687]  

ARMOURER  
 So you’re going to sit down to take a shit  
 on something worth ten minas?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Yes I am, you fool. Do you imagine  
 I’d sell my asshole for a thousand drachmas?[^note-688]  

ARMOURER  
 All right, then, hand over the money.  

TRYGAEUS [standing up and rubbing his bum]  
 No, my good man, it irritates my ass.  
 Take it away. I won’t be buying it.  

TRUMPET MAKER  
 What am I going to do with this trumpet.   
           
  
 I once paid sixty drachmas for it.  

TRYGAEUS  
 Pour lead in this hollow part, then up here  
 fix a long stick on top. And then you’ll have  
 a target for your game of cottabus.  

TRUMPET MAKER  
 Damn you, you’re making fun of me.  

TRYGAEUS  
 All right,  
 I’ll give you another idea. Pour lead,  
 as I said, and attach a pan right here,  
 using small cords, and you’ll then have something  
 to weigh figs for your servants in the fields.  

HELMET MAKER  
 O you damned spirit who’s destroyed me,   
           
  
 I once paid a mina for these helmets!  
 Now what do I do? Who’ll buy them now?  

TRYGAEUS  
 Go sell them to the Egyptians. They’ll do  
 for when they measure out their laxatives.  

SPEAR MAKER  
 Alas, helmet maker, things have worked out  
 so badly for us.  

TRYGAEUS  
 This man’s not suffering,  
 not in the least. 

SPEAR MAKER  
 What about his helmets?  
 Who will use them anymore?  

TRYGAEUS  
 He should learn to attach handles to them.  
 then he’d sell them at a much better price   
 
 than he does now. 

HELMET MAKER  
 Let’s go, Spear Maker.  

TRYGAEUS  
 No, not yet. I’m going to buy spears from him.                                                                             
  

SPEAR MAKER  
 How much will you offer for them, then?  

TRYGAEUS  
 If they were split in two, I’d purchase them  
 as vineyard poles, a drachma per hundred.  

SPEAR MAKER  
 We’re being insulted. Come on, friend, let’s go.  

[The various arms dealers and weapons manufacturers all leave. As Trygaeus gives  
his next speech, two young boys emerge from the house]  

TRYGAEUS  
 Yes, you should, because children of our guests  
 are coming here to take a piss. I think  
 they’re also going to sing the opening parts  
 of what they will perform. Now, young lad,   
 
 what song do you intend to sing? Stand here  
 beside me and before you go inside  
 sing the beginning of your song.  

SON OF LAMACHUS [chanting]  
      “So now let us begin with younger warriors . . .”                                             
  

TRYGAEUS  
 Stop singing of warriors, you wretched child.  
 We’re at peace. And you’re a cursed idiot.  

SON OF LAMACHUS [continuing]  
      “When they’d come close up against each other,  
 they smashed their ox-hide bucklers and their embossed shields.”  

TRYGAEUS  
 Shields? Will you stop reminding us of shields!  

SON OF LAMACHUS [continuing]  
      “Then came men groans with shouts of triumph too.”   
 

TRYGAEUS [interrupting]  
 Men’s groans? By Dionysus, you’ll be crying  
 as you sing out those groans and embossed shields.  

SON OF LAMACHUS  
 Then what should I sing? Tell me what you like.  

TRYGAEUS [quoting from Homer]  
 “Thus they feasted on cattle meat.” Stuff like that.                                                                       
  
 “They set out breakfast, all the sweetest food to eat.”  

SON OF LAMACHUS [reciting again]  
      “Thus they feasted on cattle meat and, tired of war,  
 loosed their sweating horses from the harnesses.”  

TRYGAEUS  
 That’s the stuff. They were fed up with warfare  
 and then they had a feast. Sing about that—  
 about how they ate after they were tired.   
 

SON OF LAMACHUS  
      “When they were finished, they strengthened themselves . . .”  

TRYGAEUS  
 I’m sure they were feeling really splendid.  

SON OF LAMACHUS [continuing]  
      “. . . and poured from the towers. A mighty shout arose . . . “

TRYGAEUS [interrupting]  
 To hell with you, boy, you and your battles!  
 You sing of nothing but war. Whose son are you?                                                                      
  

SON OF LAMACHUS  
 Me?                         

TRYGAEUS  
 Yes, by god, you.  

SON OF LAMACHUS  
 I’m Lamachus’ son.  

TRYGAEUS 
 Bah! Listening to you sing, I was wondering  
 if you might be the offspring of someone  
 addicted to war, who’s sad without one.  
 Go away! Sing your songs to the spearmen.   
 
 Where’s that young son of Cleonymus?  

[The Son of Lamachus goes in the house and the other child,  
the son of Cleonymus steps forward]  

 Sing me something before you go inside.  
 I don’t think you’ll sing about stuff like that.  
 Your father’s a far too prudent man.  

SON OF CLEONYMUS [singing]  
     “Some man from Sais now glories in my shield,  
 that splendid shield, which I left, against my will,  
 beside a bush . . . “

TRYGAEUS [interrupting]  
 Tell me, you little prick,  
 are you singing about your own father?                                                                                                
  

SON OF CLEONYMUS [continuing]  
      “But I saved my life . . . “

TRYGAEUS [interrupting]  
 And shamed your parents.  
 But let’s go in. I’m sure you won’t forget   
 
 what you’ve just been singing about the shield,  
 not with that father of yours.  

[Trygaeus and the Son of Cleonymus start to go into the house.  
Trygaeus turns to address the Chorus]  

 You people who are staying here, your work  
 is to chomp on all this stuff, chew it up—  
 don’t just pretend you’re working. Get to it  
 like real men, with both jaws grinding hard.  
 You poor sods, your white teeth are no use at all  
 if they’re not used for chewing.                                                                                                                      
  

[Trygaeus goes into the house]  

CHORUS LEADER  
 We’ll take care of it. Thanks for telling us.  
 Now those of you who were hungry earlier   
 
 get going on this hare. It’s not every day  
 you come across cakes going around unclaimed.  
 So eat up, or I say you’ll soon be sorry.  

[Trygaeus emerges from the house]  

TRYGAEUS  
 You must speak fair words now, and let the bride  
 come out here. And bring the wedding torches.  
 Let all the people rejoice together  
 and sing and dance with us. Now, too, we must  
 take all equipment back to our land once more      
 once we have danced and poured out libations,  
 kicked out Hyperbolus, and made our prayers   
           
  
 to gods to enrich the Greeks, and make us all  
 harvest many barley crops together,  
 with lots of wine, figs to eat, and may our wives  
 bear children for us, and may we gather  
 once again the good things we started with  
 all the things we’ve lost and set aside  
 the glittering iron of war.  

[Opora comes out of the house with her attendants]  

 Come, wife, to the fields,  
 and, my lovely one, may you lie                                                                                                                   
  
 in such beauty at my side.  

[In the following exchanges one half the Chorus sings in response to the other half]  

 FIRST HALF CHORUS  
 Hymen, Hymenaeus, O![^note-689]  

SECOND HALF CHORUS  
 O thrice blessed man, you deserve

 when you’re drinking plenty of wine.

 Hymen, Hymenaeus, O!  
 Hymen, Hymenaeus, O!  

TRYGAEUS  
 Good bye, men, good luck,  
 and if you follow me  
 you’ll be eating flat cakes!  

  


[^note-601]: . . . eat the stuff: Stealing food in the kitchen was a common complaint against slaves.   

[^note-602]: . . . or the Graces: Aphrodite is the goddess of sexual love, and the Graces are the goddesses of grace and charm.  

[^note-603]: . . . shit all day: Cleon was a very influential politician in Athens who had died shortly before the production of the play. He is one of Aristophanes’ favourite targets, even after his death.   

[^note-604]: . . . windbags: This would be a pointed reference to the important political officials sitting in a special section of the audience.  

[^note-605]: . . . Medes: The term Medes refers to the Persians who in Asia Minor were still keen on interfering in Greek political matters.  

[^note-606]: . . . to the ravens: In Greek is this a common expression for “Going to Hell,” or “Going to the dogs.”   

[^note-607]: . . . for a sauce: This obscure joke, Sommerstein explains, depends on the very similar words for knuckle or punch and for a tasty delicacy.  

[^note-608]: . . . in Naxos: The Greek word for beetle (kantharos) was also used to refer to a certain kind of boat (evidently associated with the island of Naxos).   

[^note-609]: . . . Beetle Harbour: Piraeus, the great sea port near Athens, was, Sommerstein notes, officially called the Harbour of Cantharus (the Greek word for beetle), after a local hero.   

[^note-610]: . . . into some tragic glory: Aristophanes is fond of mocking the tragic dramatist Euripides for the way he liked to portray physically injured heroes.  

[^note-611]: . . . ass hole: The reference to Chios here is obscure. If an Athenian were killed in a state subject to Athens, there was a large fine of five talents. But Chios is a long way from Athens, so it’s not clear how that law would apply.   

[^note-612]: . . . Athmonum: This is the name of a political district to the north of Athens.   

[^note-613]: . . . will pay: The twin gods are Castor and Pollux (orPolydeuces), twin brothers of Helen and Clytaemnestra, and important Peloponnesian gods. Attica is the region of Greece around Athens. The Peloponnesian War pitted Sparta and its allies, mainly in the Peloponnese, against Athens and its allies.   

[^note-614]: . . . on to Pylos: Pylos, in the south of the Peloponnese, was the site of a major set back for the Spartans (a few years before the production of Peace), when the Athenians took 300 Spartans prisoners and set up an occupying force. The prisoners were an important bargaining chip for the Athenians, since many came from the finest families in Sparta.   

[^note-615]: . . . a man’s legs: A reference to the way War make men’s knees tremble or, Sommerstein suggests, perhaps to an involuntary bowel movement brought on by fear. 

[^note-616]: Prasiae: a small coastal town in the Peloponnese.  

[^note-617]: Megara: an important city state to the west of Athens, close to the Isthmus of Corinth.   

[^note-618]: . . . to a powder: The tanner referred to is Cleon, an important Athenian politician and a favourite target of Aristophanes. He is famous for stirring the people up in favour of war. Cleon died in   BC, shortly before the production of Peace.   

[^note-619]: . . . initiate of Samothrace: The phrase refers to a member of a religious cult located in Samothrace, an island in the Aegean Sea. This cult, Sommerstein explains, was famous for the success of the prayers offered by those initiated into it.   

[^note-620]: . . . Datis: This is probably a reference to the commander of the Persian expedition sent against Athens and defeated at the battle of Marathon in 490 BC.   

[^note-621]: . . . Good Spirit’s cup: This odd expression seems to mean that it’s time we all enjoyed common good fellowship. Sommerstein notes that after a meal there was a tribute of neat red wine to the Good Spirit, after which the drinking began in earnest.   

[^note-622]: . . . Lamachus: the name of an Athenian general who, in Aristophanes’ eyes, was too eager for the fame and wealth he garnered in battle.  

[^note-623]: . . . rations for three days: The orders for military expeditions required the people to bring food for three days with them.   

[^note-624]: Cerberus was the famous dog guarding Hades. This mention of his name seems to be a reference to Cleon, the aggressive Athenian politician in favour of war, who had recently died.  

[^note-625]: . . . “Hurray! Hurray!”: cottabos was a favourite dinner game which involved throwing drops of wine into a balance beam. A Sybarite is one famous for devoting his life to pleasure.   

[^note-626]: . . . to Phormio: Phormio was a successful Athenian general famous for his ability to endure hardships and insisting his men did the same.  

[^note-627]: . . . with sword and spear: The Lycaeum was a place in Athens where soldiers practised military drills.  

[^note-628]: . . . just like Cillicon: Cillicon betrayed his city Miletus to its enemies. When asked what he was doing, he said “Nothing bad.”  

[^note-629]: . . . with a lottery: The Athenians seem to have drawn lots for the order in which they executed condemned criminals. Hermes was the god of chance. 

[^note-630]: . . . I meet my death: Trygaeus is treating his death like a military campaign and complaining that he’s being called up too quickly, so that he hasn’t had time to get his three days of rations.   

[^note-631]: . . . myself initiated: This phrase refers to the ritual of being initiated into a mystery religious cult. The ceremony required a sucking pig. Those initiated were supposed to enjoy a happier after life.  

[^note-632]: . . . great processions, too: Pisander was an Athenian general of reactionary political inclinations.  

[^note-633]: . . . they were used to be: Hermes was the god of thieves and a famous thief himself.  

[^note-634]: . . . those scoundrels: The phrases about stealing daylight and biting each other’s disks are references to solar and lunar eclipses.   

[^note-635]: . . . will honour Hermes: The Panathenaea was an Athenian festival dedicated to Athena. The Mysteries were a celebration of the cult of Demeter. The Dipolia was a festival honouring Zeus, and the Adonia celebrated Aphrodite and Adonis.   

[^note-636]: . . . his shield again: The allocation of lines in this speech and in those which follow is much disputed. I have followed Sommerstein’s suggestion (although not entirely) and left Hermes in charge of the libation prayers, with Trygaeus making the frequent interruptions, since this seems to be the most dramatically plausible arrangement.   

[^note-637]: . . . as Cleomenes: Cleomenes was an Athenian who disgraced himself by dropping his shield and running away from battle.  

[^note-638]: . . . for joy: This comment arises from a pun in the Greek, since the word cry out with joy (paean) closely resembles the word to strike.  

[^note-639]: . . . Enyalius: Ares is the god of warfare. Enyalius is an alternative name for Ares and also the name of a separate god of war.  

[^note-640]: . . . your monster: Lamachus, an important Athenian general, had a shield with a Gorgon’s head depicted on it (the face of Medusa, which in traditional mythology could turn men to stone).  

[^note-641]: . . . from both sides: In the war both Athens and Sparta sought to win over the Argives as allies, but the Argives maintained a shrewd neutrality. Eventually they joined up with the Athenians. Sommerstein suggests that this line may be a reference to Argives working as paid crewmen on both Athenian and Spartan ships.   

[^note-642]: . . . keep getting in their way: The phrase about the Spartans “in jail” is a reference to the many Spartan prisoners captured by the Athenians at Pylos. They were kept chained up in jail in Athens (the Greeks says “held to wood,” referring to the chains attached to the beams in the prison). For them Peace will be much more welcome than for the arms makers, who make weapons.   

[^note-643]: . . . of hunger: Athenian hostilities against Megara had brought starvation to many in the city.   

[^note-644]: . . . garlic on her: This phrase means, in effect, to get her angry. Sommerstein points out that fighting cocks were fed garlic to make them more pugnacious.  

[^note-645]: . . . the sea a little: This is a reference to the military policy of Pericles, the major political leader in Athens at the start of the war, which urged Athenians to put all their faith in the their fleet, rather than in organizing land expeditions against the Spartans.  

[^note-646]: . . . penned by Euripides: The Dionysia was the major drama festival in Athens, a celebration in which Peace was produced.  

[^note-647]: . . . with cups attached: The cups were small metal pieces designed to relieve swelling. The bruises come from wounds they have received in fighting each other.  

[^note-648]: . . . but in Sparta, too: Phidias was the most famous sculptor in Athens. He was accused of stealing materials (including gold) from a public commission for a statue of Athena and was banished. Pericles, the leading political figure in Athens, was a close associate of Phidias and one of those charged with overseeing the work. The Megariandecree prohibited any people of Megara from coming to Athens and shut down all trade with the place. This was an extreme hardship for the Megarians. The suggestion here is that the origin of the Peloponnesian War was linked to this scandal. The Greek text does not mention Sparta by name, but uses the phrase “over there,” a clear reference to the Spartans.   

[^note-649]: . . . held out for war: Before the war Athens had developed an alliance among a number of city states, allegedly for defensive purposes. Athens insisted forcibly that these city states pay them tribute money, claiming that they would provide the naval forces for defending them all against the Spartans and their allies. Many of the tributary states were not happy with this arrangement.   

[^note-650]: At the start of the Peloponnesian War, the Spartans attacked Athenian territory by land. The Athenians, following the advice of Pericles, abandoned the countryside and brought the country people into the city. These refugees were in considerable distress, and some special welfare provisions were made for them. The “demagogues are the public orators of the party urging war (notably Cleon). Brasidas was an important and (for a while) very successful Spartan general. His death shortly before the production of Peace was one of the reasons there seemed a real chance that the cities might end hostilities. The man who dealt in leather is the demagogue Cleon (who had also died shortly before the production of Peace, as Trygaeus’ next speech indicates).  

[^note-651]: . . . your people: Hermes was associated with Hades, since he accompanied the spirits of the dead to the underworld.  

[^note-652]: . . . whisper to him: It’s not clear whether or not Peace actually does whisper something to Hermes in this and later speeches or if he just pretends that she does. Since Peace never says another word in the play, the latter option seems dramatically more plausible, especially since Hermes seems to really like lecturing the audience on all the things they did wrong.   

[^note-653]: . . . in your assembly: At Pylos (in 425 BC) the Athenians won an unexpected victory and captured   
Spartan citizen-soldiers, a very serious blow to the Spartans, whose population was relatively small. The Spartans made peace overtures in an attempt to get the prisoners released.   

[^note-654]: . . . the rocky Pynx: Pynx is the name of a hill where the Athenians held their assemblies.  

[^note-655]: . . . by Hyperbolus: Hyperbolus was a leading Athenian politician, a radical demagogue who inherited Cleon’s role after the latter’s death. He is a favourite target of Aristophanes’ satire.  

[^note-656]: . . . into Simonides: Simonides was a famous lyric poet, well known for his love of money. The line seems to suggest that Sophocles is trying to get money (or more money) from writing.   

[^note-657]: . . . on a wicker mat: It is not clear what these lines mean exactly. Sophocles was about seventy-five years old (and lived for many years more), but there’s no sense elsewhere that he was a greedy or rash man. Sommersteinoffers the tentative suggestions that these lines may refer to a risky business venture.  

[^note-658]: . . . still living: Cratinus was a well known comic poet who died shortly after the Peloponnesian War started.   

[^note-659]: . . . pennyroyal later: pennyroyal was (and still is) a widely used herbal remedy for a number of things, including eating too much fruit. Oporia’s name literally means “full fruit.”   

[^note-660]: . . . the lightning bolt: Hermes’ speech here,Sommerstein points out, is a quotation from a lost play by Euripides, which refers to the fabulous winged horse Pegasus.  

[^note-661]: . . . Ganymede’s ambrosia: Ganymede was a royal prince of Troy who was so beautiful he was taken up to Olympus to carry Zeus’ cup and be his sexual playmate. 

[^note-662]: . . . camels arse holes: This is a monstrous portrait of Cleon, one of Aristophanes’ early targets. Sommersteinnotes that the phrase “Bitch Star” comes from a female equivalent for “Dog Star” (a particularly bright part of the night sky), which happens also to be the name of a notorious prostitute. Lamia is a well known monster, but is normally female, in which case the “balls” on Lamiawould be non-existent, another slur against Cleon. The switch to the first person suggests that either Aristophanes himself is stepping forward to speak or that someone in the chorus is impersonating him. Hence, I have assigned this first-person section to the Chorus Leader.   

[^note-663]: . . . balding skull: Aristophanes frequently makes fun of his own baldness.  

[^note-664]: . . . with their play: Carcinus was an Athenian tragic dramatist and his sons were well known as actors and dancers. They were apparently quite small in stature. 

[^note-665]: . . . by a weasel: It’s not clear what this reference to a weasel means. Perhaps it’s based on a popular story about Carcinus, or perhaps the description is supposed to mean that his play was like a small and nasty rodent.   

[^note-666]: . . . stink like goats: Morsimus and Melanthius were tragic poets and frequent targets of Aristophanes (especially for their bad poetry and eating habits); the Gorgons were monsters with large teeth and a reputation for gluttony, and the Harpies were winged monsters with a woman’s face and a vulture’s body. The roach mentioned is the fish (the Greek word also refers to another fish, the skate, but the English pun on roach also helps to bring out their disgusting greed.  

[^note-667]: . . . are being rolled up: These foods are traditional wedding dishes.  

[^note-668]: . . . and screw: Brauron was a town outside of Athens were there was a large celebration in honour of Athena every four years, a festival well known for its debauchery.   

[^note-669]: . . . Isthmian Games: These games were important and popular athletic competitions. Visitors set up tents on the site. The mention of the games allows Trygaeus in his next long speech to introduce all sorts of sexual innuendoes when he describes the games the councillors can now play  

[^note-670]: . . . close to the spectators: In Aristophanes’ production,Theoria would have been played by a male actor disguised as a female. Her “nude” body, Sommerstein points out, would be covered with something (a flesh-coloured body stocking, perhaps) painted to depict breasts and public hair. The ambiguous sexuality underlies a good deal of the ribald humour which follows.  

[^note-671]: . . . reaching for a peace: This obscure joke, Sommersteinsuggests, seems to depend on a similarity in sound between the word for hand (which would make the listeners think the official was reaching for a bribe) and the word for peace.  

[^note-672]: . . . grumpy little Hermes: This refers to the frequent custom of placing small statues of Hermes outside people’s homes. The First Servant is apparently complaining that the statue of Peace deserves more than these small household items.  

[^note-673]: . . . just like Theagenes: Theagenes was a citizen of Piraeus (the port of Athens), well known for his ugly appearance and disgusting habits.   

[^note-674]: . . . a slang expression: In the Greek the animal proposed is a sheep, and the First Servant uses a word from the Ionic dialect. Trygaeus’ response is “But that’s an Ionian dialect word.” The use of the word bummer (a slang expression for an orphan lamb) is an attempt to get something out of this exchange, especially in connection with the First Servant’s next two speeches.  

[^note-675]: . . . give him something: Chaeris is the name of a musician notorious for his inept playing.  

[^note-676]: . . . by the women: Sommerstein notes that this comment does not necessarily mean that women were not permitted to attend performances (although it might refer to that). There is evidence from other texts that some women were present at these performances.  

[^note-677]: . . . our Lysimache: the name literally means “put an end to fighting.” It’s not clear whether this name refers to anyone specifically.        

[^note-678]: Melanthius was a tragic poet with a reputation for gluttony, and Medea was one of his plays. Beets were commonly served with eels.  

[^note-679]: Stilbides was an important diviner in Athens who went along on the disastrous Sicilian expedition. The slur is that he needs war in order to prosper at his trade and thus won’t be happy about a successful offering to Peace.  

[^note-680]: . . . one more time: Bacis was a well-known diviner from Boeotia who allegedly got his inspiration from the nymphs.   

[^note-681]: . . . at the Prytaneum: The Prytaneum was an important sacred building in Athens where very distinguished people could eat at public expense.   

[^note-682]: . . . by the Sibyl: The Sibyl is a prophetess in a shrine. Hierocles may be referring to the prophetess of Apollo at Delphi.  

[^note-683]: . . . to Elymnium: Oreus is Hierocles’ home town, andElymnium is an island off the coast of Euboea, close toOreus.  

[^note-684]: . . . horse cock: This is an imaginary creature, a combination of a horse and cock with wings.  

[^note-685]: . . . at his misfortune: Pandion’s statue is a place in Athens where important public notices were posted, in this case the name of citizens going on the next military expedition.   

[^note-686]: . . . placed beside it: Sommerstein observes that the Greeks used stones to wipe themselves.  

[^note-687]: . . . on the ship: People paying for the warships sometimes stopped up the oar holes to save themselves the expense of a full crew of rowers. Inspectors required crew members to put both hands through the oar holes so that they could count the actual number of rowers.  

[^note-688]: . . . a thousand drachma: Historians estimate (roughly) that   
drachma in Aristophanes’ time was worth about   
dollars today. A mina is equivalent to   
drachmas. 

[^note-689]: Hymen, Hymenaeus: The traditional wedding song, a tribute to the god of weddings, Hymen or Hymenaeus.
